Saw The Gallows with Noah. That movie was messed up.
So The Gallows is the scariest movie I've seen in a very long time...
The gallows is a good movie
The Gallows update: the scares in this movie are not very intelligent or nuanced. it just jars you with loud noises over and over again

I request volunteers to take me to see Max, The Gallows, Magic MikeXXL, Paper Towns, Ant Man, and The Minion Movie because I have a dollar..
I'm not being biased here - Aussies, you should pick #insidiouschapter3 over that "meh" of a movie that is The Gallows. I3 is 100x better.

Amnesiac is on scary movie
Movie idea: Woman found half dead by boy. Has amnesia and rebuilds her life. Finds out she was a different person. Nature vs nurture ensues.
Last night's movie: "Before I Go to Sleep" (2014). Woman with amnesia meets neurologist, starts making videos for self. Okay thriller. 6/10

"Before I Go to Sleep": the most interesting thing in this movie for me is how the story depicts a type of Amnesia that actually does exist!
@Noodzer @cannoncanons Yeah, but the character keeps repeting over the movie that he doesn't have amnesia... hahhaa
"Before I Go to Sleep": this movie tells about a woman who's suffering from anterograde #Amnesia, and wakes every day with no memory.
Irony: Watching a movie about an amnesiac who slowly remembers his memory - and slowly remembering I've seen this movie before.

Honestly like fifty shades of grey the book better than the movie
The only good thing that came after "Fifty Shades Of Grey" movie is it's soundtrack.
I actually hate how much Fifty Shades of Grey was changed for the movie..
My parents are watching Fifty Shades of Grey in the living room.. This movie should be watched in their bedroom.
I'm obsessed with the Fifty Shades of Grey movie and it's basically because of the soundtrack
Can't wait for the next Fifty Shades of Grey movie to come out

Never get bored to watching this movie.... ★ Fifty Shades of Grey — https://path.com/p/xIqUg 
The movie was all about their sexual relationship and the book focused a lot more on their emotional relationship. #FiftyShadesOfGrey
#FiftyShadesOfGrey #MovieNightIn Hope this movie is a good one..
Finally saw Fifty shades of grey last night... Have to admit I laughed the whole time. Corniest love movie ever! Not even worth it
Fifty Shades of Grey is a boring ass movie. The man seemed more psychotic than romantic..
