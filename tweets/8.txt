Oh hi NPH in 'Gone Girl' and fellow Whedonverse actor Ben Affleck* as well. *This is true. He's in the Buffy movie.
Does Gone Girl get better the more I see it, or am I just more and more thankful I'm watching this and not a superhero movie?
Gone girl is still the biggest mindfuck of a movie gives me goosebumps
"Gone Girl" was such a good movie , damn man that shit was crazy

Gone girl is such a creepy movie

Gone Girl is an extremely fun movie... I kept thinking "I gotta rewatch this".. But then after 15 minutes of rewatching, I just stopped it.

@addyshanlon i love gone girl also amy dunne w/ all my heart nothing could turn me from the light of that book/movie
ash heard like fifty seconds of gone girl when i was watching it & critiqued it & caused me 2 have an existential crisis abt the movie
Watching Gone Girl for the first time this movie is all sorts of fucked up
Movie night with the family and I chose Gone Girl, completely forgot Ben Affleck eats your ones box within 5 mins of the start :)
@WhatLexySaid Gone Girl is a superb movie. Makes me fear ever getting married though. As if the thought wasn't already terrifying.

Why did I not know about Gone Girl? Saw the movie and now I'm mad I didn't read the book
Gone Girl is a Lifetime movie with an incredible director, a star studded cast, and a hollywood budget. But it worked
Seeing all these articles advertising Dark Places as "almost as good as the hit novel/movie Gone Girl" wat. Pick up a book son.
New movie coming out from a Gillian Flynn novel (Gone Girl). It's called "Dark Places". My daughter auditioned for it. Great script.
Watching Gone Girl again ..I love this psycho movie so damn much
Watch this movie called Gone Girl
Gone Girl will always be the most fucked up movie of all time

Gone Girl was a pretty decent movie...psychotic but decent
When you watch a movie everyone and their mothers rave about only to be highly disappointed. I'm looking at you, Gone Girl. Yikes.
Okay don't get me wrong, Gone Girl was a great movie and all but...what kind of ending was that?... #merp
Ben Affleck you dumb Fuck, Gone Girl was supposed to be a Novel/Movie not your current relationship status.
Gone Girl is still the best movie I've ever seen

'The Martian' is a really good book-based movie, btw. Saw it yesterday and was impressed. Book's still better though ;) They always are...
Can't stop thinking about The Martian... such a great movie. I've already started the book.
I love the spooky, secret billionaire, skin-of-his teeth expository flashback scene of every book and movie…except The Martian
Nope! The Martian was the best movie I've seen since The Imitation Game. I go to A LOT of movies. https://twitter.com/Variety/status/659071383549308928 …
Saw #TheMartian and left underwhelmed. Saw #CrimsonPeak and was floored! Best movie of the year!
So I started reading #TheMartian last night, and I almost got pulled into staying up all night.Gotta get it done for my movie date Sunday!
Told CG that if she finishes reading THE MARTIAN by Saturday we’ll go see the movie. I’ve urged her to prioritize it over her schoolwork.
If you liked "The Martian" movie, this is a must watch :) Just How Scientifically Accurate Is 'The Martian'? https://youtu.be/Nx5NZw5jSNA 
#TheMartian Great movie. Make the best of what life deals you. Never give up hope. Pay attention at school in science classes.
The Martian was such a great movie, I wanna watch it again.

A 10-second movie review: The Martian. Like Cast Away, with hunkier Tom Hanks as stranded dude. I was sorry Wilson didn't make trip to Mars.
Things I learned from The Martian: Apparently it's possible for Sean Bean to make it to the end of a movie.
"The Martian" looks like a really good movie, but I'm still mad at Matt Damon for his role in "Intersteller." Fuck Matt Damon..............

This guy gets me: "The Martian is the worst sci-fi movie since Prometheus - an utter clunker." I must have laughed for 5 minutes.
@hngrch @thetimepast and I wonder when will there be time for another THE MARTIAN type movie to fit in a gap and do well.
I read "The Martian" over the weekend, after seeing the movie last week. It's a great book. If you've not yet read it, I'd recommend it!

The Martian. A perfect startup movie. It has it all: A mission, a team, building, failing and learning along the way. But never lose hope.

Am I the only one that thought #TheMartian was a prequel, or in some other way related to #Interstellar when the movie posters came out?

Late update from this weekend but The Martian was a good movie. Reeeally long so take a lunch or something but overall it was aight.

The Martian http://goo.gl/1MmwDe  - A movie abt optimism and the will to survive. Made me want to immediately go on an intrepid adventure.
The Martian was prolly the best movie I've ever seen, even though there was a distinct lack of little green people.
#TheMartian is a space movie for people who expect to be bored by space movies (me). Smart, funny & made me want to read the book. 5 stars!
Took a break to see The Martian. Watney is a pretty cool botanist, but Ellie Sattler is still my favorite movie botanist.
My praises go to Matt Damon in The Martian. Wonderful movie adaptation to a book. Two thumbs way up
The Martian with Matt Damon=20/10 would recommend - best movie I've ever see in my life

Really enjoyed The Martian movie, but I have to wonder about people who are saying it's better than the book.

The Martian (the movie): excellent adaptation of Andy Weir's novel. Still glad I first read the book, though.
The Martian movie, Destiny Taken King, water on Mars, Star Wars: Ep. VII. Another fantastic year for space.
THE MARTIAN IS SUCH A GOOD MOVIE GO SEE IT

Went and saw #TheMartian finally. I have read the book and loved it. The movie was very well done. Loved it. Now let's get to Mars for real!
I really liked #TheMartian - both the book and movie had awesome but different things going for them.
The Martian is a really good movie.
The Martian was a great movie. Pretty sure I could survive on Mars, I've played a few survival video games.
@clintingtons Have you seen The Martian yet? Best movie of the year. Ending was ... no spoilers.
I think I might take myself to see the Martian movie. It's just weird going to the movies alone....... Not really something I would do.
And for the first true leisure book this year, after the recommendation from @fmdfrank, I finished The Martian. Now, I can see the movie.

For the record- The Martian is the best movie I've seen in a while. Really great story. #TheMartian #Mars
#TheMartian had some puns in the movie that you're supposed to laugh to, but no one was So only my friend and I were laughing. We're nerds.
The Martian was a well-made and entertaining movie with 0 new ideas & no scraps of thinky sci-fi. Did you know Kristen Wiig was in it? 3/5

The Martian was already a perfect movie and @donaldglover made it perfecter

The Martian was a really good movie
The Martian...GREAT GREAT movie i love space...so awesome
The Martian was alot more cheery than I expected, was smiling pretty much half of the movie
The Martian was the best movie I've seen in a really long time, honestly.
Finally was able to see #TheMartian. I thought it was a great movie! Congrats on the great role, Matt Damon! (1/3)
Saw The Martian today which is the first movie I've seen in theatres since Gone Girl and I forget how much fun the cinema was! 
It's good to see Sean Bean stay alive in at least one movie. #TheMartian
The Martian is possibly the best movie I have ever seen! It is amazing.
Took longer than I wanted but I finally saw #TheMartian. Great book turned into a great movie. Well done.

The Martian was an extremely entertaining movie. The real heroes though were @donaldglover and potatoes.
#TheMartian is the best movie I've seen in a while! It was very captivating, loved it
Whoever wrote The Martian has a hilariously dry sense of humor. Not to mention the movie itself was fantastic.
Tori and I saw #TheMartian . It was awesome! Quite simply everyone in the movie acted great.
French toast at Cracker Barrel, saw The Martian with Caleb, scolded some dumb kids for talking during the movie... good day, good day.
The Martian UI Reel. Interesting User Interface design work for a blockbuster movie. #design #UI https://vimeo.com/142143279

S Club (7)'s movie: Seeing Double. I remember their first 3 albums that I purchased back in the day. #throwback pic.twitter.com/Fso0A0Pxeq
The Martian: Bizarre movie. Good SFX & cinematography. But what is it? Scify? Popcorn flick? Drama? & Matt Damon's character is unrelatable.
The Martian was awesome. Really enjoyed the movie. Strongly thinking about listening to the audiobook.
I went and saw the Martian today and it was very good!! Didn't feel like a 2 and a half hour movie.
The Martian might be the best movie I've ever seen..
The Martian is not a movie you should watch before you plan on turning up.
@MaiaraWalsh I have to watch that movie. Reading the book. It's awesome! #TheMartian
#TheMartian was an awesome movie! Enjoyed it with my parents
The Martian was a great movie.
The Martian was GREAT! I highly recommend this movie!!! pic.twitter.com/gg1lzrNhgu
'The Martian' good good movie!! Just too long for someone my age to sit thru Even Mark stayed awake to the end!

@kateesackhoff Just back from #TheMartian - 3D breath taking+as always, @jes_chastain =amazing! (We swear, not 1 bad movie on her resume!)
Just finished watching the Martian. Great movie!
When you watch the Martian, and forget you're on earth for a split second when you come out of the movie.
Watched The Martian tonight. Great movie. Matt Damon was really good. Also loved that the message was that science saved him and not heroism
The Martian played the Joy trailer & the Mockingjay trailer & made the movie 100000000% better than it was
Finally get to see The Martian tonight! Hope the movie lives up to the book…
Changed movie theaters to watch #TheMartian and to say hi to @icecreamconebun ! It's always interesting to meet Twitter people IRL
Mad Max>The Martian>every other movie this year.
Wow, what a movie! #TheMartian

The Martian was such a fantastic movie

The martian is such a good movie and matt damon could get it all
Just watched the Martian. Have to say that is one hugely over hyped movie. Where did the hype train come from on this one?
saw The Martian, they grabbed a lot of the spirit of the book. went light on the science, but still more than usual from a Hollywood movie
Second movie I have gotten to this year, Inside Out and The Martian. 2 for 2. Solid flicks
Movie night... (@ Cineplex Odeon Queensway Cinemas - @cineplexmovies for The Martian 3D in Toronto, ON) https://www.swarmapp.com/c/0v2x4VoOiM1 
As one who LOVED Mark Watney on the page, #TheMartian is a great movie & #MattDamon is a great Mark!
Great Movie. Had me glued to my seat whole way through. #themartian https://instagram.com/p/9PN-jjG6f7/ 
The plan for today was see my future apartment and go see the martian with my mom. The apartment won't work and the movie was sold out.
I'm so into Childish G that I screamed when I realised he was in the movie the Martian #truelove
#TheMartian was very well done! I loved the story, very original. It is a science fiction movie so of course i loved it..
One aspect of #TheMartian movie I really love is all the details the medium switch allows. We actually see Mark's despair, his relief & joy.
In the past few weeks I've seen The Martian, Crimson Peak, Steve Jobs, and the new Paranormal Activity movie. Crimson Peak was my favorite.

Went to see #TheMartian today, awesome movie, totally unexpected.
Movie 3: The Martian. And now I think I'll quit while I'm ahead. That was an excellent way to spend the day.
The Martian was just a movie about a space pirate and I loved every second of it
#TheMartian I really liked the reference to #thelordoftherings and bonus @SeanBeanOnline didn't die in this movie !
#TheMartian This is a must see movie, Matt Damon, is terrific! pic.twitter.com/gjY9YSzgNj
The Martian was absolutely class. It's so refreshing to see an uplifting and funny space movie #myjam
The Martian. Such a good movie. Ridley Scott at his best.

The Martian....best movie this year.
Did people really see the Martian for Sebastian stan he was in the movie for like 2 minutes lmao
I just saw the Martian and I'd just like to say, congratulations to Sean Bean for not dying for once in a movie
Check out #HISEAS today at #SOESTHawaii #SOESTopenhouse and try on the #MartianHelmet from #TheMartian movie! pic.twitter.com/ce6gOhIoTA
The Martian was the best movie I've ever seen.
Trying to decide what movie to go see tonight, bridge of Spies or the Martian
#TheMartian is a good movie, great sarcasm and plot elements, bot in my top ten favorites of all time, but top 15? Yes
Date night tonight - off to see The Martian in 3D! Movie looks great and the reviews have been favorable.
Now I need to read a good book. I'm thinking either Red Rising or The Martian since the movie is coming out. Anyone read either?
Aside from The Martian, pretty much every movie released this month has bombed.
Yep, the Martian is a good movie indeed
"This is that weed that Matt Damon smoked when he made the movie The Martian"
#TheMartian If you haven't seen the movie "The Martian", go see it Matt Damon, was Great! Good Movie 5 stars!! pic.twitter.com/kfFn9Md81T
The Martian was THE WORST movie I've seen in a long time. Terrible acting, horrible story, and dumb effects. Avoid it. #oppositeday ;)
#TheMartian: I liked the book better, which surprised me a bit. And don't get me wrong--I loved the movie. Future cable TV poppy field.
the martian was such a good movie tbh but if you don't like space and science and stuff it might bore you at some parts.
This movie is absolutely amazing. Guys you have to watch it !! #TheMartian pic.twitter.com/kcYTR8o9X9
The Martian is just the best movie in like the past few years :D
@cirquelar @MarsSanDiego @LarsTheWanderer Saw the movie "The Martian " tonight, it was really good, brillant, good acting and very realistic
The martian var my kind of movie
The Martian was a great movie. From start to finish.

gonna see the martian tonight with folks although i just wanna see the goosebumps movie tbh
"I thought he was gonna befriend an actual Martian... So I was waiting for it, then I gave up." @KaitlinWolfford on the movie The Martian.
There's a lot to like in #TheMartian movie, a lot! But oddly it felt like I'd seen it before. And I don't mean the saving Matt Damon thing.

Great review of a great movie : https://frama.link/martien  Once Hollywood "clichés" are filtered, lots of good stuff stays. :)
"Burnt" which stars Bradley Cooper and Emma Thompson is probably the best movie I've watched in 2015. Too much hype about The Martian.

Saw The Martian. What a great movie! An ode to science based thinking!
Saw "The Martian". It's a good movie. I hope to be alive when we arrive to Mars. 
The Martian was the best movie I've seen in a while.
Today I saw The Martian, the movie. You should, too. Yes, you, one of my nine twitter followers. Unless you plan to read the book?
Is it weird that as soon as I came home from seeing #TheMartian I ate some potatoes? It is essentially a movie about potatoes, right?

The Martian,” the film made roughly $55 million in the first weekend, the second largest opening for an October movie. #seriousfilms
Just watched the Martian with Matt Damon. Brilliant movie. Makes me wish I paid more attn in science class. #Genius
SO. The Martian is a contender right up there with Interstellar for best space movie of the year. Beautiful filmography!
I'm tryna see the Martian movie
"The Martian" was litterally out of this world. Excellent movie
Just watched #TheMartian . Brilliantly performed. First movie I think I've felt legitimately tense throughout. Great balance of humor.
Went to see #TheMartian today. 'twas really nice to see a movie end happily for a change. Altogether, quite a good movie.
The Martian, best nerd movie for a while. Unfortunately forgot the url of final credits for further info. Have to change ringtone :)

Saw #TheMartian. Solid movie. Wish Matt Damon could play someone other than Matt Damon just once, though.
So, make no mistake, #TheMartian is a GREAT movie, but while content is not super mature many really young kids might not follow the action.
Went to see #theMartian with @BadBarrister , excellent movie and great start to long weekend.

The Martian isn't about Martians but it's a great movie
Just saw the Martian oh my best movie in a while 11/10
Have you seen #TheMartian movie? Can you see a space alien? Mr. Space Alien() was filmed, but he can't tell if was for a movie or research!
we're watching the martian in class and i did NOT know sebastian stan was in this movie
#TheMartian #movie was much more entertaining than the book as I predicted. But mostly, I love that the guy next me to me fell asleep
The Martian is the most Mars-based movie of 2015.
It's official, The Martian is the really good movie that I've been waiting to see for a while. If you've not seen it yet, do so soon!
#TheMartian was a pretty great movie
The Martian is a kick ass movie that made me cry, almost throw up and get angry all in 2 hrs. Also, Matt Damon. Simple as that. #TheMartian
This is actually a feel-good movie, with humour as its main ingredient. http://www.dacouchtomato.com/2015/10/review-the-martian.html … #TheMartian
Wonderful. The movie #themartian is 100 percent free of coonery and buffoonery by black actors! Excellent. Great movie all around.
the Martian was a kickass movie
the martian is such a good movie i give it a 9
I tried so hard not to cry in another space movie but damn it #TheMartian was good
#TheMartian was by far the most fucking fantastic movie I have seen in a long time! Well done!
I think if the martian would have been released before Interstellar it would have been perceived way better, a good movie just overshadowed
Home from dinner and a movie. Had fun, made a friend, definitely enjoyed "The Martian." https://instagram.com/p/9Ncq1Orgwx/ 
Read "The Martian" so can see the movie now. Started among others "Best Served Cold", my signed copy by Joe Ambercrombie. #booklover
That movie where ghosts = Matthew McConaughey in a time warp and Matt Damon is stranded on a planet all alone. Not the Martian #Interstellar
The Martian is the best movie I've seen in a long time, and quite possibly one of the best films I've ever seen period
Saw The Martian last night. Good movie, but... a 2x2 video wall with no bezel compensation and a GoPro for your VC camera. C'mon. #avtweeps
The Martian is a good movie
The Martian was actually a really good movie lol
The Martian = badass movie
The entire time during The Martian I was just lowering my standards to which characters were hot until I decided all of them :/ gr8 movie 2

#TheMartian is a very good movie. The book is excellent as well. #BringHimHome
once the martian is on netflix who wants to come over & have a space movie marathon & watch that & interstellar & gravity
The walk, Goosebumps, The Martian, Bridge Of Spies and the list go on..that's a lot movie in pending to watch..
THE MARTIAN IS SUCH A GOOD MOVIE PLUS MATT DAMON IS HOT SO
God damn The Martian movie was long aff
well, all i can say is that anyone who felt that the movie "The Martian" didn't connect emotionally for them should get their head examined.
MUST READ: The Martian. The movie's not bad too. Mark Watney will forever be the unlikely disco king of Mars. #StayingAlive
The Martian was a good ass movie
The Martian is a great movie omfg.
The Martian is the best space movie I've seen in a really long time. Definitely worth it!
So happy that I had a movie date with @GraysonPeebles. The Martian was sooooo good

The Martian was a damn good movie. Had some good comedic timing at times.

What's the best movie you've seen lately? — the Martian was really really good tbh http://l.ask.fm/igoto/45DKECN75V62DDAUPY6IQO7Q72NS5LAIR7Z6BDFVCCS2J7FI2AT5A6KOFREMASRUKS27QFIBINRH6FIN5U36Y3N7NLRP5BJDXAAQDBCPIR3SEK6PA6MD4JHXTT5O5VDVTCUYAVIDZXKE3F4EICDQURLE72IHT74O23OURUDLTKWI2I47GRDX5XPV2BALT47GRM7YYSYZ …
Saw the martian twice and i still wanna see it for the third time. Such an amazing movie and actor.
The Martian is an awesome movie
Everyone should go see The Martian. Coolest movie of the year
Just saw #TheMartian. Even having read the book, I was still holding my breath during the ending. Highly recommend both book and movie.
I have FEELINGS about how they changed the ending to The Martian ... but also: how did I not know Sebastian Stan was in the dang movie?
Really liked Steve Jobs and the Martian. But Sicario is the best movie of the fall so far.
Avengers Age of Ultron was nominated for my movie of the year but The Martian might have pushed it out of the way
The Martian=space + Castaway which also equals awesauceness So um yeah it was a good movie
"if u wanna see a good movie, go see the martian" oh honey, i already know. ive seen it three times. get on my level
Just saw #TheMartian, great movie, enjoyed it almost as much as the book. Definitely don't approve of the Iron Man ending though.
Just saw The Martian and omg it's such a movie, extremely well made. Congrats to the whole cast and crew for their masterpiece!
#TheMartian is a really great movie ! The visuals were amazing & the story was entertaining :) pic.twitter.com/poo4ZlYyWu
"I saw a movie of a man who farmed potatoes on mars and used his on shit as fertilizer" - what @helll_ena got from watching the martian
I HIGHLY recommend The Martian. Fantastic movie.

Okay, so: The Martian? Fucking FANTASTIC movie. But I'm also sci-fi trash so take that as you will.
Just saw #TheMartian . It was an amazing movie. Fantastic plot & a lot of great actors. Definitely go see it if you haven't already! -Brian

#TheMartian was a snooze fest! Castaway in Space! Was waiting for Wilson to make an appearance and the movie dragged on.
The Martian was a very good movie. It was also a very good adaptation.

If you have not yet, go see the Martian. One of my top 5 favorite movies of the last 10 years in my mind #martian #movie #review
I recommend everyone go see The Martian, if you haven't already. What a phenomenal movie.
What a wonderful movie The Martian is.
The Martian was some good shit honestly best movie I've seen in awhile

I went from seeing four movies at #PFF24 to the Studio Movie Grill in Upper Darby for "The Martian". Five films in one day is exhausting.
Just saw The Martian with my 2 my two friends phenomenal movie!!
Loved The Martian movie but felt like it would be best served by a longer, episodic format. Poll time! @donttrythis
I could never buy a book whose cover is a still image from the movie. #TheMartian

Never have I had a movie give me so much anxiety .. but damn it was good #TheMartian 
Just saw The Martian great movie!
The Martian was a good ass movie and basically proves that Childish Gambino can do literally anything (like save an astronaut)
DAVID BOWIE IS PLAYING IN THE MARTIAN MOVIE OMFG MY FAVE
Just saw The Martian, absolutely fantastic movie... Besides the ending... Ending was absolutely terrible. 3D also added nothing too it. 8/10
The Martian was a good movie, but I was dissapointed that there wasn't actual martians in the film #Liars
Movie night tonight. Watching the Martian
Saw the Martian, then read the book, then saw it again. Even better the second time. Great, great movie.
Wow the Martian was a great movie
Apparently the @JoeyBats19 homer has been collected by Matt Damon on Mars. Now a part of #TheMartian movie sequel.
@_mariewold should have mentioned that I've already seen the Martian  I agree with y'all though, such a good movie!
Just saw the martian and wow can chiwetell ejiofor just be every movie for the rest of film? Thx

Watched #TheMartian good movie but the book is a million times better #pirateninjas
It's been a while since I've jumped on a book-became-a-movie-so-reading-it bandwagon. The Martian is living up to the hype. Unlike Twilight.
The Martian movie is extremely good. You owe it to yourself to go see it. I know I hype a lot, but I've never been so enthralled by a movie.
@thebirthdayboys The Martian, now this. We're a couple weeks away from a Shworvels movie.

The Martian was a beautiful movie because of beautiful Jordan. Mars on Earth is Wadi Rum except we have oxygen, humans and a lot of food
Biggest takeaway from finally seeing The Martian last night is the movie making a Council of Elrond joke w/ Sean Bean actually in the scene.

The Martian is such a good movie! I couldn't breathe during the last 10 mins of the movie! #TheMartian
Have no interest comparing book to movie. The Martian was a great piece of film-making by an accomplished director Ridley Scott.

Finally saw The Martian. 2 immediate thoughts 1. 20th Century Fox movie with CNN reporting 2. No mention of Russia or Roscomos space program
Great movie but the book had so much more detail. I recommend it. #TheMartian https://instagram.com/p/9Kv6TJIDPy/ 
The Martian is a great movie. However, the soundtrack should be left on Mars, please.
The Martian was a really good movie! And I'm not one to watch space movies but I thought it was great!

THE MARTIAN proves that smarts and fun aren't mutually exclusive. The feel good movie of the year, and a big fist pump for science nerds.
The Martian is such a great movie!!
I said that "The Martian" is the first book I've read before seeing the movie but that's not true, it was Neuromancer.

Saw The Martian yesterday. A really great movie, even for those who aren’t sci if fans. And a love letter to space exploration.
S/O to Hollywood for The Martian. Loved being lost in space for a couple of hours. Good, old-fashioned movie fun.

#TheMartian is good. But Matt Damon marooned on Mars is not the most interesting thing about a movie about Matt Damon marooned on Mars
Who wants to see The Martian with me this weekend? Gambino? Damon? Mars? Science? What more could you want out of a movie?!
The Martian was a good movie. Donald Glover's scene was by far my favorite part of the whole movie though.
The Martian was 10/10 easily tied with 'Interstellar' for my #1 movie somebody go with me to watch it again
Just saw The Martian with @Aeniwastaken super good movie.
Night two of movie watching! Just saw Bridge of Spies. Really good but if you can only see one then I'd go with The Martian.

@dariusv00 saw the Martian movie and changed my mind
I give The Martian (movie) 4 stars, vs 5 for the book. If you've experienced neither, do the movie first.
The point when the movie stopped being believable, for me, was when the well-funded American space program showed up. #TheMartian #PoorNASA

I don't think I have what it takes to spend 4 years on Mars because I'm barely gonna make it 2 hours in this movie theater. #TheMartian

Wanna give a big hug to the guy who used Bowie's "Starman" in the Martian movie soundtrack.

The Martian is a 8/10 movie. Nothing extraordinary but entertaining.
Walked from my house to @mjrdgtlcinemas 16 Westland for "The Martian" First time watching a movie at a theatre alone, feels weird.
Still don't know about the movie, but The Martian by Andy Weir is the best sci-fi book I've read in a long time. Highly recommended.

Anyone out there ? Go see #TheMartian ....fantabulous movie .... #LeapOfFaith that nothing is impossible ! Even though fiction but still
The Martian is such a good movie
And hey, I loved Gravity. But the Martian is a good movie even if you watch it on an Ipad y'know?
Speak for yourself Landis! *crunches up the Martian movie poster and eats it* https://twitter.com/Uptomyknees/status/655971387723517952 …
If you love a good space movie, you have to watch Interstellar, Gravity, and The Martian
I enjoyed watching The Martian and look forward to giving the book to Max. Also the movie made me think of this: http://www.npr.org/2015/10/15/448980982/action-movies-love-that-typing-sound-but-where-does-it-come-from …
Watched #TheMartian and it was the first time I heard a movie theater crowd applaud since #Rocky in 1976. #NASA #Ares #Mars #JPL
The Martian is a crazy good movie. I'm glad it's facing so much success
#TheMartian was the best movie seen this year. Granted I haven't seen many but, it was F***ing awesome. That's a movie reference.
Enjoy a good survival & rescue movie? Go see #TheMartian. Easily one of my fave films in 2015
The Martian is an amazing movie
#TheMartian is a must-see, captivating but also superhero-kind movie. Enjoyed it very much.

The Martian was a badass movie.
1. #TheMartian is the first movie I've seen at the cinema this year, and it was 100% worth it. Showcases humanities greatest attribute: Hope
#TheMartian is a very good movie, but it's nowhere close to as good as the book.
Damn. Another out of this world movie, literally.The Martian was ridiculous. I sweat my Chapstick out my hands.
@cdixon I read/liked the book, didn't love the movie: https://medium.com/@charlesforman/the-martian-some-issues-315ba5d1a9a9 …
The real question is who filmed The Martian if Matt Damon was all alone on Mars ... Dumb movie
Just saw The Martian. Incredible movie. Made me want to go into space RIGHT NOW.
@EligibleDrop pretty good saw the Martian movie was so good
Wife & I loved reading “The Martian”. Finally got a date night to see the movie. So good. Can’t wait til our son is old enough to enjoy it.
Really intresting movie...if you enjoyed Cast Away, give this movie a go. — watching The Martian at AMC... http://fb.me/6QitH1xeE 
The Martian was a sick ass movie
The Martian was my favorite movie of this whole year by far.
I just saw a certain reddit post and now I feel like I should read the Martian book instead of the movie.
The Martian is the greatest movie ever. #TheMartian
Just watched The Martian and I must say 2 thumbs up, possibly the best movie of this year for me. pic.twitter.com/B3Uz9cCwm0
The Martian is probably the greatest movie recently made...really make you wonder #MattDamon
The Martian is well worth the money! Great movie
The Martian is the best movie I've ever watched. Hands down.
When you nerd out in the movie theater because you made the same bomb in chem club that they made in The Martian!
My @jes_chastain movie weekend was a rousing success! I highly recommend both #CrimsonPeak and #TheMartian!

Maybe Jessica chastain made less money than Matt Damon for the Martian bc she was in the movie for about 20 minutes total
Just finished watching #TheMartian Very well done. Loved the problem solving nature of the movie and the tenacity to keep going.
The Martian was a fantastic movie. I'm happy to see that Ridley Scott is back to making great movies again.
The Martian was a great movie but lets wait like ten more years to put Matt Damon in a situation where we have to save him again

The most unbelievable thing about The Martian was the fact that Sean Bean stayed alive throughout the whole movie #SpaceIsComing @Trevor787
The Martian is a great movie not gonna lie
My cousin and her perfect timing ... "Movie?" ... "The Martian?" ... "Meet you there." ... *running down the street* #movies
the martian is such a bad movie omg i fell asleep for like an hour #TheMartian
The Martian is an almost perfect movie, everyone needs to see it
The Martian highly exceeded my expectations. Amazing movie to say the least
Holy guacamole, #TheMartian was worth the wait. Decent chance it'll wind up being my favorite movie of the year.
Just left "The Martian" with my buddy Fred. With a few exceptions, I had a ball. We desperately needed a happy-ending movie right now.
The Martian was the greatest movie I've seen in a while
I have to say The Martian was a great movie.
THE MARTIAN is a great movie if you can sit through 144 minutes of ABBA-bashing without walking out in protest.

This movie is awesome and hilarious! My favorite line: "I'm gonna science this sh*t!" #TheMartian pic.twitter.com/bEY92fgwfI
The fact that the Martian has "Project Elrond" in it and Sean Bean is in the movie makes my nerd self beyond happy
Just saw the martian. It was the best astronaut movie released this year, no lie... And definitely ranks in the top 3 in the last 3 years.

Went and saw The Martian tonight. It was a fantastic movie.
Expertly written. Expertly directed. Expertly edited. Wonderfully acted. The Martian is the one movie this year I can recommend to anyone.
#TheMartian, Ridley Scott's best movie in quite some time.
I just finished reading the martian, 5 minutes before the movie starts. Started reading it yesterday evening. What a book.
The Martian is an incredible movie
They overcasted for The Martian movie tbh... Sean Bean? Gambino? Kristen Wig?The twelve years a slave man whos name i can't pronounce?
Finally got around to seeing THE MARTIAN. WOW. Great movie! And it does justice to @andyweirauthor's wonderful book.
#TheMartian was an awesome movie! Check that shit out
Sam and I saw The Martian tonight, it was such a great movie. Everyone go see it!
Just saw the Martian with @Britbev5 great movie and a good way to spend my last day back home
between Harry Gregson-Williams’ The Martian and now @danielpemberton’s Steve Jobs score, this is already a great autumn for movie scores.
Finally got to see The Martian tonight and it didn't disappoint. Great movie. Even better book. Looking forward to more from Andy Weir.

The Martian is a great movie with in your face product placement of Cisco, Panasonic, Hamilton, and human excrement.

The movie "The Martian" correctly used pounds/feet, because the "metric" system was based on Earth's radius, and thus invalid for Mars.

Coyne reportedly watching movie Crimson Peak at Scotia Bank Place as The Martian sold out. Bought big package of Twizzler. #FreeAndrewCoyne
Dear future film makers, make your movie more like The Martian. Great acting. Great sets. Great CGI. Great jokes. Great tension. Great plot.
A movie has to be 10/10 for me to buy it on BluRay. I'm buying The Martian on BluRay.

i think the biggest diff between The Martian book and movie is the book assumes you care why Watney is doing anything and the movie doesnt
The Martian was visually impressive, but another movie in which rugged individualism + american exceptionalism saves the day? #againsthope
the martian is THE BEST movie i have ever seen in my life
Watch The Martian high as hell and I guarantee you it will give you the best movie experience.

Watching a movie with a main character who shares a first name with you is weird. In other news, I just saw The Martian!
"The Martian" was a solid flick, B+. Strong visuals, impressive pace for 2 1/2 hour movie. Much respect to all astronauts out there. Crazy.
Just saw The Martian with my dad. O_O what a great movie.
Once again, a space movie with Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain is the best film of the year. #TheMartian

Just saw The Martian. I suspended disbelief through most of the movie, until they showed that Sean Bean’s character lived till the end.
@AkabaneEiri if you haven't watch The Martian http://www.spacemov.com/the-martian-full-movie-watch-online-putlocker-hdfree47/ …
If you are blind or visually impaired, it's worth seeking out an audio described showing of "The Martian." Good movie, great book.
I just watched the Martian and I've never watched a more stressful movie in my life
OK which movie would my 4.9 yo son enjoy more ...the new Steve Jobs flick or the or The Martian. Daddy is really... http://fb.me/2mnWzKILQ 
Went t to the movies and watched the martian. That movie is hella good.
Is it me or the orange detailing, do the @Sphero BB-8 and #MattDamon in the new @20CenturyFoxUK movie #TheMartian look slightly similar?

Def took advantage of bottomless mimosas ending a great weekend of shopping, horseback rising, and best movie in a long time #TheMartian
"I can't believe there were no Martians in a movie called the Martian.... that's so dumb" .... what?
#TheMartian - amazing experience. Brilliant visuals. Movie rides on Matt damon's stellar performance.

Watched The Martian in 3D today. It was FANTASTIC. Best 3D I've ever seen in a movie too, and I don't even like 3D movies :)
The Martian was the best movie, EVER
The Martian. Great movie, but weird structure. Epilogue felt off. Still gotta love movies that promote space travel. #TheMartian
#TheMartian was a damn good movie. Can't go wrong with Matt Damon science-ing the shit out of stuff.
everyone needs to see The Martian. I haven't seen a better movie in a while
I liked a @YouTube video from @vashandjustin http://youtu.be/szU9_CmLaWU?a  The Martian Movie Review - Vash and Justin
here's a little scene I wrote that was rejected for a movie that shall remain nameless. #TheMartian #BringHimHome pic.twitter.com/2xfaqpaW6z
I honestly never expected any movie go live up to the book. I have to say, The Martian comes pretty close. Hats off, Ridley Scott and team!
Finally about to see The Martian. Loved the book. Can't wait to see this movie.
Finally finished reading The Martian...maybe I'll go see the movie next week...
Childish gambino is definitely in the movie the Martian

The Martian is a very good But Interstellar is still a better space themed movie.

The Martian was a good movie. Being with you was better.
The Martian is probably the best movie I have ever seen hands down
After Interstellar, I really didn't trust Matt Damon in Space, but the Martian proved me wrong. It was an awesome movie to watch.
The Martian is a good movie, I almost cried. 7/10 would recommend.
Got around to reading the last 170 pages of The Martian earlier, then saw the movie. Such a fantastic story of humanity coming together.

The Martian was a pretty epic movie.
I watched the movie, "The Martian"; let's just say it was really good and I enjoy it -- it'll be cool if Matt Damon that played him...
On the fence about seeing The Martian? Check out what our resident movie expert thought of the film http://on.nowth.is/9r4 
The Martian is a fantastic movie. There's going to a lot of awards for this one.
The Martian was a good movie. Definitely worth seeing. Also, Rich Purnell is me.
The Martian was an A1 movie
“This movie could stand on its own, even under Martian gravity” - @astro_Pettit @NASA http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-10-13/what-happened-when-room-full-engineers-watched-martian … #TheMartian
"I'd probably die within 10 mins. Eat all the food, drink all the water and weep. But that was such a feel good movie though." #TheMartian
F' it. I went to go see The Martian. Nice, light movie w/ some geeky math. Not a deep movie as I'd thought, but still enjoyable.
The Martian was also a fantastic movie, I highly suggest it!
If you havent seen the Martian yet go right now. Drop your phone and run to the nearest movie theater. Why are you still reading this GO
THE MARTIAN WAS SUCH A GOOD MOVIE LIKE WHAT

The Martian was hella good, had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I've never been so nervous & anxious during a movie in my life
The movie the Martian was intense
My new favorite movie. #TheMartian. Thanks #RidleyScott. See it! http://m.space.com/30831-the-martian-most-realistic-space-movie-ever.html …
The Martian was such a good movie. Long as hell though
I finally got to see The Martian today. Great movie. Totally recommend
I'm totally geeking out after seeing The Martian! Must get it for my Astronomy class- a MUST SEE MOVIE!
The Martian best space science astro movie ever
@FotoCub not according to a little movie called THE MARTIAN it isn't!
Just saw The Martian. very very good in my opinion. An awesome, science-dense movie that... made me want to do my calculus homework. idk why
The Martian might be the first movie where order does not matter; read the book first or after. Now GET YOUR ASS TO MARS!
Part of me absolutely cannot believe Ridley Scott made The Martian, because holy shit, that movie is GOOD
Castaway + Apollo 13 + Saving Private Ryan = a really good movie (The Martian)
If you have the chance to go see The Martian - do it! It's a fantastic movie.
I love smart people. My views might be bias towards #TheMartian But the science in the movie is logical. So... pic.twitter.com/YfKLFUw3u5
The Martian was an awesome movie
The Martian is a great movie and I highly recommend that everyone should go and see it
Saw The Martian today. Good movie, but sadly I can confirm they don't use "Macgyver" as a verb even once. Crimson Peak didn't either.
If you're into space exploration, you're going to enjoy this movie. Even if you're not, you'd still love it #TheMartian
The Martian is an amazing movie.
The Martian was a great movie

when I saw the martian today sebastian stan was in the movie and overtime I saw him I just quietly screamed bucky!
@p4nleague @bri_north go to the movies and watch the Martian. Easily the best movie I have ever seen. And the science in it checks out 100%
every time we go see a movie car wants to change his lifestyle, he wants to become an astronaut now bc we just saw The Martian
i got 3/4 of the way through the martian and i was like "wow the whites finally made a movie and didn't pair 2 characters up" but alas,
#TheMartian was a great movie. Go see it! Matt Damon was fantastic. Thrilling, beautiful Mars landscape, & awesome soundtrack. Go now.
"The Martian" is a great movie. Y'all should see it
Finally was able to see #TheMartian. Great movie! Definitely a Best Picture nominee.
Saw the Martian 2day.. Disappointed tbh. A bit boring. Had all American cliches stuffed in 1 movie.. Only bright thing was Matt Damon. 6.5.
#TheMartian movie review: Awesome. 8/10. Suka tengok orang bijak figure out ways to solve problems.
If there was an Oscar for Feel Good movie of the year, The Martian would be a shoe-in.
Just saw the Martian, great movie

Just saw The Martian. Great movie. Esp moved by the global humanity coming together. Also @donaldglover stood out. pic.twitter.com/v48Mfhoy20
The Martian is the greatest movie in the history of movies, if you haven't seen it you're missing out
Just watched The Martian. Natasha after the movie, "wait so which one was Matt Damon?"
The Martian is the rare movie that's even better the second time. @MartianMovie
Watched #TheMartian with the missus. Great movie ! Now she's looking into the International Space Station on @NASA's website :)
Love The Martian Movie but such a commentary on the invisibility of Women of Color & white women over 30. Astonishing.
The Martian was a great movie. That being said Interstellar > The Martian.
Couldn't believe how amazing The Martian was! That's the definition of a good movie! #TheMartian
'The Martian' is a fantastic movie.
@lizbon @Ben_M_Berry And The Martian is a top movie these days. :)
Just saw #TheMartian, good movie. Anything is possible with science and duct tape.
Made three attempts to see the Martian movie tonight, all sold out. Is it really that good? #wtf
Matt Damon doesn't sound anything like Marvin #TheMartian, and they forgot the death ray. Great movie though.
Ive heard that the Martian is a good movie, is this true
The Martian: Super fun movie in which science is the superhero. Women & men collaborative problem-solving & absence of cleavage=refreshing
Yup, The Martian holds up. A rare instance where you should read the book AND see the movie. A couple of my fav parts left out, still great.
Put Matt Damon in The @MartianMovie to good use in math class, less so in science, http://news.schoolsdo.org/2015/10/movie-review-the-martian/ …
I'm confused by the martian movie in that Sean Bean didn't die. #TheMartian
The Martian is recommended by me to the whole world. Such a great movie!
the Martian was suchhh a good movie oml
Everyone go see The Martian such a good ass movie
'The most realist thing about that movie was the fact they used duct tape to fix everything' - my dad(an engineer) #TheMartian
The irony of "Iron man" with Michale Peña and Sebastian lol #TheMartian great movie, Ridley Scott still best director
The Martian was lowkey the best movie I've seen this year so far
Instead I saw The Martian with some friends. Great movie.
The Martian Review. This is my first movie review! via http://www.advancesafetysolutions.com

Hands down best Movie of the Year!!! #TheMartian pic.twitter.com/SRfAVeYblK
#TheMartian is a hell of a movie! So awesome I have no words. Matt Damon sell Mark perfectly the photography is out of this world ( )
im going to see the martian tonight i hope it is a good movie
"The Martian" is AMAZING. I can't remember the last few me I came out of a movie that ... giddy.
Another note about the Martian: So great to take my daughter to a movie FILLED with women in science, or in command.
I watched the Martian again today that movie is just so freaking good
Just saw #TheMartian and let me just say, best movie I've seen in a long-ass time
Highly recommend the #martian #movie. Great movie! Makes me excited for space travel and our future #nasa #future #goseeit #science
The Martian movie is fabulous, and the book is even better.
#TheMartian is a fantastic movie! Go see it if you haven't already. Matt Damon killed it with integrity and wit.
Damn The Martian movie was so good
The Martian has to be one of the best movies this year. Great movie.
I'm so excited to see the Martian movie. The book was phenomenal. A true science fiction marvel to read.
The middle-aged couple behind Nathan and I in line at cineplex is arguing about whether the movie is called 'The Martian' or 'The Martin'
Not gonna lie, I cried during The Martian. And it was the best movie i've seen in a while.
There's something extremely satisfying about reading a book, then immediately going to see the movie and not being disappointed. #TheMartian
Go science! #TheMartian Amazing movie. Great depictions of working scientists.
JESSICA CHASTAIN'S CHARACTER IN THE MARTIAN LOVES ABBA I FEEL SO ALIVE AND THE MOVIE ISNT EVEN OVER YET
The Martian is seriously the best movie I have ever seen.
Finally saw the Martian after a disappointing movie yesterday. So good!
The Martian is such a good movie * inserts potato emoji*
'The Martian' is a great movie. Matt Damon deserves some Oscar love for his performance
Dam it the movie it's sold out so I cannot watch it that suck I really wanna watch the Martian

Wanna read The Martian cause the movie was great but there's one copy in the entire Hawaii library system and there's 67 requests for it so
The Martian was a great movie. @lovereally__
You know you're a real pessimist when you spend the entire movie dreading a bad ending... Btw #TheMartian: totally recommended
Finally saw The Martian. What an awesome movie. Let's go to Mars, humanity! (I also read the book which was really good as well)
Finally going to see The Martian tonight! Loved the book, and I'm quite sure the movie will live up to it.
THE MARTIAN and BRIDGE OF SPIES were both so great that I don't even mind that the other movie at the Apollo is HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA 2.
#WriteTip: Read The Martian book and then see the movie. Note how Ridley Scott's theme was not the book's theme. #OctWritingChallenge

The Martian is a very good movie.
The Martian's opening scene was fucking intense. Great movie overall.
Just left the theater...watched #themartian great movie and gives this #indyauthor hope that I too can find such success.
Eva, re. the Martian: "Why does he only grow potatoes? Does Matt Damon just play hyper-Irish in every movie he does?"
If you haven't seen "The Martian" yet, go see it. It's a terrific movie.
#TheMartian movie — so anticipated, so below expectations.
Started reading #TheMartian last night. Awesome so far! #amreading Can't wait to go see the movie too.
The Martian was a good movie but one of the longest movies I've ever watched!!!

"The Martian" was a really good movie I definitely enjoyed it
Matt Damon in #TheMartian brilliant!!! Excellent movie. If you've not seen it, go see it. 60 sec movie guy is full of it.
Loved #TheMartian. Excellent adaptation of the book. Space is terrifying, but that movie brought all the happy feels.
The Martian is a fucking triumph. One of the best supporting casts in recent movie history.

If the Martian doesn't win any awards, then I will be seriously surprised. That movie was so freaking good.
Finally got around to watch #TheMartian. What a fantastic movie. And I highly recommend the book. If possible, read the book first.
Just seen #TheMartian, felt a bit like if was produced by @WIRED or @TEDTalks. All very clever but kind of forgets it's a movie.

Finally saw #TheMartian. Very disappointed. Jeff Daniels did fine, but Christopher Lloyd isn't in the movie even once! Some prequel.
The Martian was the best movie I've seen in a long time
So, “The Martian” is such a good book that even dumbing down, shortening and casting Matt Damon did not make it a bad movie. Solid. 4/5

the martian was such a good movie 10/10
The #Martian: Great movie combining rocket science, NASA, and potato farming. I'm a fan.
I always want to curl up in a ball and cry after I watch a good movie. #TheMartian #theemotions #iwillalwaysloveMattDamon
RT @DevaDaggerous It's rude how Matt Damon takes top billing in The Martian when the real star of the movie is Duct Tape.

It's rude how Matt Damon takes top billing in The Martian when the real star of the movie is Duct Tape.
The Martian was an amazing movie plus "Donald Glover" was in it lmao still Childish Gambino to me
Having a space sci-fi movie marathon today. #TheMartian definitely gives a a more humorous vibe compared to other recent sci-fi movies

@Flrsi You will enjoy it. The Martian is one of my favourite books and the movie is one of my favourite movies for this year.
Just saw #TheMartian - most accurate rep of scientists in a movie. Except physicists totally call things fast like UFOs (ultrafast outflows)
Watched The Martian with @BERUDAYM and Jun. The movie was awesome.
Just back from watching The Martian. Enjoyed it almost as much as the book, best movie since Argo.
Saw The Martian at the cinema today, what an informative and uplifting movie! Love that murph was now a commander in space ;)

3 major complaints about The Martian movie. First, neither the humor from the book nor the music mentioned were used to full effect.
Off to see The Martian. One of the few times I've read a book pre-movie.
Also The Martian: the first Ridley Scott movie that I've given a shit about about in 23 years.
You wont find a better movie about potato farming than The Martian.

Review: 'The Martian' is just the movie space travel needs http://flip.it/kuR4P 
#TheMartian was a fantastic movie. Absolutely enjoyed it. Great acting by Matt Damon and brilliant film. Kudos to the legend, Ridley Scott.
Just saying, having seen The Martian, I would watch the hell out of a @realmichaelpena/ @donaldglover buddy cop movie.
The Martian was cool, fucking Donald glover was in the movie cibai rapping shit about maths
Verdict: The Martian is a very enjoyable film. @WizendTurnip recommendations are trustworthy. @goneawayawhile is a great movie buddy.
I just saw "The Martian" and LOVED it! If you only see one movie this year, see this one. The suspense was edge of your seat. #themartian

It's interesting that people said The Martian would spark interest in space travel. If a movie can do that, it would've been Tomorrowland.
Any movie about space automatically has my full attention.. #TheMartian was really good, definitely a treat to watch!
Halfway through @TheMartian. This movie is out of this world!!
If there was ever a movie about Perseverance in Problem Solving, it's The Martian. http://fox.co/1MvZzmh  #smp

The Martian is the best movie of the year. We’ll revisit this after Star Wars, but I don’t think it will change.
So I'm feeling like a Martian after watching the lovely Matt Damon movie "The Martian". Hope you're… https://instagram.com/p/88uEr_M0Cw/ 
#TheMartian is an utterly fantastic movie, a must watch for all space fans. Ridley Scott's second best movie, (after Alien)
#TheMartian is the first book to movie adaptation where I actually liked the changes!

The Martian great movie
Saw #TheMartian great movie. Which of the Ares crew was the hairdresser for everyone else during that long mission though? #greathair
Read The Martian after seeing the movie. Enjoyed it, think the film adaptation was quite good. Some Hollywood gloss, but that's expected.
The Martian was such a good movie !!
Contrary to the title, The Martian isnt about aliens from Mars! But it was a preeeeeetty slick movie
The Martian. Excellent movie.
New favorite movie is The Martian, that was great
The Martian, another "Chinese friendly" movie, so they can show it in China.
The Martian was an awesome movie. It pleased me to see that they used a Lord of the Rings reference with Sean Bean in the same scene
Recommend the movie the Martian. It's sooooo good!

Saw the Martian today. Entertaining film. Made even more so by the choice of songs that get played during the movie
The Martian is a movie bout a white guy surviving on Mars for 2 years but a brutha can't survive past the opening credits in a horror movie.

The Steve Jobs movie was weird. If Sorkin wrote The Martian screenplay it would have been about Mark Whatley losing his cat when he was 17.

Looking forward to seeing The Martian tonight, and taking Jeffy to his 1st non-comic, non-superhero movie in a theater.

The Martian was a much happier .movie than I thought it was gonna be. 8.5/10

The Martian is a pretty good space disaster movie. If you want to see a space disaster movie, The Martian is one that is pretty good.
Enjoyed The Martian but there were definitely parts of the book that I wished had made it into the movie...
I didn’t like the first 1/3 of The Martian (too dry), but the last 1/3 had me holding my breath w/ him. Damn good. Might even see the movie.
Although an alternate movie title could've been: Unlimited Space Tape #TheMartian
So the Martian is a great movie. I probably lost 10 years of life watching it though. It was super intense.

The Martian is such an incredible movie omg
After watching The Martian movie, I was inspired how a man can ration his small amount food to survive 200 days on mars.
#TheMartian movie is all the motivation I need to slay my midterms
What do we think NASA's yearly budget is in The Martian? In real life, it's over $18 billion/yr. I say in the movie it's $50 bill/yr.
#TheMartian had some good songs but how did they never play life on Mars? Its a movie about a guy living on Mars. You had one job Ridley.
#TheMartian was a great movie
I haven't watch The Martian, The Intern, Pan or Keanu Reeves' new movie. And I found out about Crimson Peak a minute ago. #Overload
Another great movie to add to the list, thank you Ridley Scott. #TheMartian
At the end of the day, I still think Matthew McConaughey did the best job in The Martian Movie.
I read Into Thin Air a long time ago and it was a gripping book. The movie is just as recommended, Everest and the Martian are a good combo.

Wow. The Martian was superb! Matt Damon was awesome! Another space movie within a year for him. Interstellar the previous. Best of 2014.
Saw #TheMartian tonight. Loved the movie, but Matt Damon didn't look like the guy he was supposed to be playing pic.twitter.com/g1xj5huHVE
Saw The Martian. Outstanding movie and a strong contender to replace "Eurotrip" as Best Matt Damon Role
Bruh, the martian. Best movie ever hands down
The Martian was a very stressful movie
The Martian: 9/10. Who woulda knew a movie about being stranded on Mars would be suspenseful and fun at the same time? Phenomenal
if you are making a movie about Mars and forget to include Mars from 'the planets' you have missed an important opportunity. #TheMartian
I hereby decree tomorrow is movie night and I will actually go to a real live movie theater to see something. The Martian? What else?
matt damon looks sexy af in the martian movie
Way to to The Martian. Finally a movie that was well worth the 10.50
on the flip side. The Martian was a dope movie. especially for a space nerd like me. Matt Damon ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"The Martian" and "Everest" also top drawer movies (Hey, it's a movie bonanza season, folks!)
The Martian in 3D with Sophia. A wonderful father/ daughter movie night. :)
We saw The Martian tonight. Space movies are not my jam, but I enjoyed this one a lot. Great movie.
The Martian is a good movie

The Martian is probably one of my favorite movies ! Great movie loved it
The Martian was actually a pretty good movie
Everyone needs to see the movie the Martian it's fucking epic
I am still not over this movie,"The Martian". So currently i'm watching its trailer. :D
The Martian was a brilliant movie I was expecting Aliens though....
Just saw #TheMartian . What an excellent movie. Matt Damon deserves best actor. Hell of a movie
I know I'm way late on this but wow The Martian was so good. Childish Gambino and China as heroes, what more could you want in a movie?
It's $15 to see a movie in nyc but I swear I'd pay $15 to see The Martian over and over and over and over again
Just saw #TheMartian -great movie.. #creativeproblemsolving and perseverance in space!
The Martian=best movie ever
Movie marathon day again!! Plus The Martian later aaaaahhhh
The Martian was a dope movie. Highly recommend.
It's not too often a movie makes my palms sweat. Bravo @MartianMovie. #TheMartian pic.twitter.com/sS3ZuRIIl0
When you finish reading The Martian 5 minutes before the movie starts
@jes_chastain Just saw the Martian. Outstanding movie. Enjoyed it very much.
Fridays are for sangria and tapas and seeing the Martian movie with friends. @batangahouston… https://instagram.com/p/87CrbhrUtV/ 
the martian. GREAT movie.
So the guy in the movie The Martian just happened to have seeds to grow food?
Just saw The Martian. Say, @sciencequiche, the movie fixed the thing I reacted to so poorly!
Man, The Martian was a great movie. I love space. Really reminds me how insignificant we all are in the grand scheme of things.
#TheMartian might be the greatest movie I've ever seen. #MustWatch It has it all!!!
The Martian is such a good movie omg
THE MARTIAN WAS THREE AND A HALF HOURS LONG BUT IT WAS THE BEST MOVIE I EVER WATCHED AND CHILDISH GAMINO WAS IN IT I SCRWAMED

Saw The Martian and enjoyed it. Good movie & I never once felt bored. But didn't blow my socks off.
As Matt Damon would say in the movie "the Martian", the Cowboys are gonna "science the shit" out of these next 4 games until Romo is back
THE MARTIAN WAS SUCH A SICK MOVIE. SPACE IS SICK. NASA IS SICK. SCIENCE IS SICK. BEING LEFT BEHIND ON MARS IS NOTTTT SICK
I just saw the martian.....but fell asleep half way in. New movie theater reclining seats made me do it
Just saw "the Martian". Very good movie. Highly recommend it
#TheMartian was an awesome movie, or as my mother aptly calls it: "Cast Away: In Space"
The Martian was a pretty damn good movie
the martian is a great movie
Just came back from seeing The Martian. It isn't very often that a movie have that depth resting solely on one person. Amazing.
@TransitDriveIn hot apple cider: check, stars above: check, warm blanket: check, great movie (The Martian): check. Love this time of year.
That moment Sean bean makes a Lord of The Rings reference in The Martian. #awesomeness #best movie ever
There's so much to like about the movie The Martian, but one of my favorites is that Sean Bean doesn't die. #SpoilerAlert #Not
also you guys should watch the movie The Martian, it's literally the best movie ever 10/10

The Martian is one of the, if not the, best movie(s) I've ever seen. It's was so intense
The Martian is the best movie. #mustsee
@paullyt18 I'd say interstellar is better in terms of making you wonder but the Martian is a better overall movie
I don't remember it happening but I somehow became my mother and I now cry while watching every single movie I.e. Just now with The Martian
I enjoyed the Martian. :) it's also nice to have a movie buddy
Finally got around to watching The Martian. Damn good movie. Think I need to read the book now. Haven't read a good book in awhile.
Tbh The Martian is THE BEST movie that I've seen all year. Y'all should go check it out
Watched The Martian. Fantastic, brilliantly made movie. Matt Was awesome. And the movie looks beautiful.

I had 3 glasses of wine. I think The Martian will be the movie of the year.
#TheMartian was a good movie with a bit to much humor. Also people are the worst at movie theatres. Hate them.
Is The Martian really a good movie?

Just watched the movie, "The Martian"; it's incredible & may have the best quote of the year. pic.twitter.com/exvCrVBwwZ

So The Martian turned out to be in Spanish with English subtitles. But I'm really enjoying this movie
Really dug The Martian. Wondrous & fantastic. Great performance from Matt Damon. Best space travel movie since Apollo 13. #TheMartian
Finally saw #themartian. I did a nice little ugly cry. It was a good movie! However, Matt Damon was weak for using a body double.
Notice how PCAs does not list "The Martian" under FAV MOVIE...I wrote that in too
The Martian was by far the best movie I have seen in awhile!
The Martian was a good movie. You should go see it.
Thanks to the martian movie all I'm listening to atm is David Bowie and Abba. Which is actually kinda cozy these dark rainy days. Starmaaaan
Most unrealistic thing about 'The Martian'? This is a movie that Sean Bean is in and yet his character doesn't die.
#TheMartian was Ridley's best movie in years. Very faithful adaptation to an excellent novel. Exciting and inventive, yet humorous.
The Martian is such a good book! Couldn't put it down! Can't wait to see the movie #TheMartian @andyweirauthor

The Martian is a dope movie
Shoot. I just realised I bought movie tickets to see The Martian on the evening of the election. What was I thinking?
this movie is damn near 3 hours long #TheMartian
Is 'The Martian' any good? ...This is what happens when you let the boys choose. Another space movie.
@MichaelMJLondon @Seventh_Sranger Haven't seen Brooklyn yet. The Martian movie is from a more realistic angle and not so imaginative.

The martian was a pretty awesome movie. I'd say it was titally worth going to the cinema for.
What is it with Matt Damon? Why does he always gets lost or stranded ? tbh, The Martian is an excellent beautiful movie.

May go see a movie for the first time in a long time. Will it be The Martian, Crimson Peak, Sicario, or Steve Jobs?
The Martian was actually really good. Best movie I watched in cinemas this year.
Hearing Jessica Chastain being called Commander in The Martian is good enough for me to think she should play FemShep in a Mass Effect movie
Might take a break from HIMYM and watch a movie today...Maybe the Martian or something on Netflix

Just watched #IpMan. Great choreography in the fight scenes, but not a patch on the Raid films. 6/10 #film #movie #martialarts
One of my problems w/ #WongKarWai #IpMan movie #TheGrandmaster was how it treated major personal upheavals as incidental. #KungFuMovies
Can't stop watching. Great Movie Historic Movie Heroic Movie Action Guy @Donnie_Yen #IamMad@IPMan
Very quite unfortunate that I have only watched the first part out of four of @IPMan Movie...I am ashamed,cause I know I have missed
Only 1 #KungFuMovies movie to go! Tomorrow I'll watch #IpMan & then scramble to catch-up on writing reviews & hopefully a few more videos.

Lol these movie is too Gucci!! OMG #IpMan
Just finished a shoot for the new movie #TheGrandmaster. Story about #IpMan and #WingChun.
@rajvanand Yes I was aware of that and thats what made watching this movie so special for me. K11 is influenced a lot by IpMan philosophy
@anukulthakur The actor portraying IpMan in the 1st movie is amazing. Contained aggresion, precise powerful movement. Looks invincible
You don't understand how good this movie is. #IpMan
@Kaizzad yes Sir I've seen both parts of the movie and it is based on true story on the life of Ipman a legend himself & mentor to Bruce Lee
The fighting scenes are maddd!! Better than any movie I've ever seen. #IpMan
This movie is incredible! The action is just ridiculously good. #IpMan
Sedih tengok movie IPMan :/ tp bangga :)
Watching ipman! Good movie.
What amazing movie on #HBO #ipman excellent .. the martial arts moves truly unbelievable.
Jay Chou concert yesterday was not bad! 3 encores! He previewed his new musical movie too! Think ipman meets hairspray!
#IpMan best movies ever. If you like #martialarts this movie is for you. #BruceLee was one of his disciples perfecting the art of #wingchun
"I'm just a Chinese man..." "His name is Ip Man." This movie is hard as fuck. Look it up its on Netflix. #ipman #kungfu
@KingCrab15 such an unreal movie. You have great taste in movies. #IPman

Females hate when you ruin the end of the movie.
Females appreciates a guy that has good taste in movie selection.
