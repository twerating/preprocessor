#SouthPaw the movie left me in tears , wat an emotional movie
Unfortunately, Southpaw is a dreadful movie w/ a script so miserable that no performance by Jake Gyllenhaal or anyone else could compensate
I thought from the reviews that Southpaw was a cliche-ridden movie blessed with page great performance.
I watched Southpaw last night. it was a great movie I don't think I've watched a good movie like that in forever
Saw south paw last night.... I cried pretty much throughout the entire movie
