Finally saw Mad Max: Fury Road. Amazing that a 70yo director of a 36 year old franchise made such a modern, strikingly original movie. Great
We're up to Thunderdome tonight, which I described to my girl as not only not the best Mad Max film, it's not even the best Muppet movie ...
Mad Max is my new favorite movie oh my goodness that was amazing.
Did they just shoot the Warcraft movie on the abandoned Mad Max set?
I'm not sure watching the last Mad Max movie on my Brazil flight was good talk preparation. OTOH, *THAT* was something crazier than async.

CHARRED REMAINS?! Huckabee has seen that new Mad Max movie one too many times. #GOPDebate
Thanks for leaking the intro footage to the next Mad Max movie, CNBC.
Is this CNBC montage the opening for the #GOPDebate or the next Mad Max movie? Jesus H Christ...
@LouiJover Is Mad Max just known as Max in Australia? Wouldn't surprise me if you were a consultant on that movie. pic.twitter.com/yyOKNKohGy
Mad Max fury road, a stupid, interesting, time wasting, worth watching movie
Gonna watch the new Mad Max movie now
@m_tounn you can watch something a bit different, mad max: fury road maybe, really good movie
By degrees I'm realizing that Mad Max: Fury Road was the best movie I've seen in a very long time.
NIGHTMARE FUEL would be a good subtitle for a MAD MAX movie.
I added a video to a @YouTube playlist http://youtu.be/z0gGWRnoFDI?a  Mad Max: Fury Road Movie CLIP - He Looked at Me (2015) - Tom Hardy,

I propose that they take all this garbage out of the movie theaters and just play Mad Max 4 on every screen forever.
Watching Mad Max Fury Road in class. What a terrible movie.
Movie pitch: Like Mad Max, but instead of fighting for water and gas, post apocalyptic humanity fights over the last mobile wifi hotspot.

Without question the original "Mad Max" is as a good of a modern revenge movie as there has been. V. solid. Great soundtrack + just builds.

I think Mad Max: Fury Road has replaced Apocalypse Now as my 1# movie.

@avestal Would you have ever believed you'd ever type those tweets three years ago? "Yeah, a Mad Max movie is the best, better than Pixar"
Majorly disappointed with my movie choicewatched half of Mad Max 4 and gave up half way through. It was awful
Last movie we seen in theatres was MAD MAX
Ugh this Mad Max movie....I mean Tom Hardy tho
I just watched Mad Max: Fury Road and it was really good. It's a big, dumb action movie but that's what made it so great.

That said, I still think the 3rd Mad Max movie is the best. I'll never be beyond Thunderdome.
Mad max was a nice movie
at this point it feels like a movie needs to be as good as Mad Max: Fury Road for me to not be horribly cynical about it

7) These regressive hissy fits led me to see Mad Max: Fury Road. Best movie of 2015 easy. I was going to see SW VII anyway, though.
It Follows was a boring movie. Mad Max was good but not the epic life changing experience people made it out to be.
Mad Max Fury Road is better than any other movie this year and it's still probably not getting a best picture nom. pic.twitter.com/XfstbKUadm

If Mad Max has taught me anything, it's that if a bunch of people boycott a movie based on it's cast, film will be amazing. Starwars, u gud
Episode 7 is gonna have hella practical special effects and a lack of CGI which is what made Mad Max the best action movie of 2015
@huegolden Not according to the most recent Mad Max movie. #IJS
Am I safe in assuming the idiots who want to boycott the new Star Wars movie are the same who wanted to boycott Mad Max because of Furiosa?

@joshbrunsting @SamRS72 All I really want is for George Miller to start making another Mad Max universe movie sooner than later.
I have watched mad max fury road like 5 times now, 1 of those with no dialog and in black and white. I really like this movie.

About to watch that Mad Max movie finally
I love Furiosa to death but I have to wonder if the people upset about her not being in the sequels have ever seen another Mad Max movie
Ok guys I got the dope on Spielberg's next movie and the next Mad Max flick pic.twitter.com/mxTpbegTnL
Mad Max is a great movie
While I was watching a Mad Max movie, Drake started livestreaming. I'll have to finish watching it tomorrow. XD
i just watched mad max and i dont know what to do with myself... that was the most intense movie ever PLUS charlize theron absolutely slayed
//Speaking of Mad Max I always pictured Ethan's Halloween costume looking like something out of a Mad Max movie.
Imperator Furiosa not appearing in future Mad Max movies is actually a smart movie. Fury Road is all about her, that's her story.
Watching Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior. This movie set the standard for post-apocalyptic desolation.
*Fury Road fans unhappy the next Mad Max movie won't feature Furiosa* Yeah, it's not like this series is called "Mad Max" or anything.
As someone whose favorite Nolan movie is INCEPTION, MAD MAX: FURY ROAD all day. https://twitter.com/TheTalkingCan/status/653739782300901376 …
if there aren't at least 6 female characters with speaking roles in the next mad max movie (knife emoji)
Every Mad Max movie is standalone. There's no reason for them to have Furiosa return.
The Martian was probably the best movie I've seen in a while.. Probably right under Mad Max.
@MugenTalks What?! I didn't know that! I mean, it kinda makes sense since the movie is called Mad Max but she was my favorite character! :(
So I'm watching Mad Max Fury Road and knitting. Would this movie make more sense if I had seen the others or had ever visited the desert?
Mad max is such a good movie wowza

Mad Max: Fury Road RT @MsCP24: From wat I seen SOC RT @DregoDaGreat: 1. What's the best movie of 2015 so far?
So no Furiosa in "Mad Max 5"... that's cool. So how about we cancel "Mad Max 5" and make a "Furiosa" movie instead? http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/movies/news/a673073/mad-max-fury-road-sequel-wont-star-charlize-therons-imperator-furiosa.html#~pqWzZ2R7HIfuAk …
Yeah I haven't seen Mad Max FR either. So continue to be shock at my lackluster 2015 movie list.
'Mad Max Colon Fury Road' could be edited into a fun forty-five-minute movie, although it still wouldn't have a satisfying ending.
Nevermind the fact that 'Mad Max Colon Fury Road' is the fourth movie in a franchise with an NES video game.
Every Mad Max movie, Max moves on to another place with a whole new cast. I like it this way.
I think that'd make her the first character in any Mad Max movie to ever appear or even be referenced in a later one? Which is cool
I just watched The Madness Of Max and I have the biggest appreciation of the first Mad Max movie now. I take back everything I've ever said

Not surprising that a new Mad Max movie wouldn't feature Furiosa based on the other films. Maybe Miller should just make a Furiosa movie.

@neontaster that's how every Mad Max movie was. I like the fact that each one has a new supporting cast with Max being the only constant
#mothersmilk in the new Mad Max movie. I cant deal! #reallyphenomenalwork @helloross @tayafaber
Mad Max Fury Road. Two hours of explosions and shooting. That's all the movie is about.
Anyone surprised that Furiosa probably won't be in the Mad Max movie probably has never seen another Mad Max movie.

What is mad max without furosia? I mean Tom Hardy role was pathetic in that movie #RoadFury #Madmax
If they're smart they'll option a Furiosa movie that takes place in a parallel timeline with the next Mad Max.
No surprise that we're not going to see much of if any Furiosa in the next Mad Max movie. That narrative ended.

@hunterprime That would be a awesome movie, but by definition, not Mad Max, lol.
Wait, people expected Furiosa to be in the next Mad Max movie? Did you WATCH the movie? Her story was completed. He left!
Now watching Mad Max Fury Road (2015) English movie
@DoctorOfFizz That's the gist of it. Personally if they just deliver another quality Mad Max movie then I'll be happy without Furiosa.
Just watched Mad Max: Fury Road again. That movie is amazing. Still can't find any flaws in it. Theron is amazing, Hardy is amazing. Damn!
the best thing about mad max is that it FEELS mad max which a lot of movie games fail at; emulating the feel of their source material
@HectorG_M5 @EW Well the movie is called Mad Max not Furiosa haha I wouldn't mind a full on Furiosa movie
That's weird since the movie's about Furiosa and not Mad Max. Or was she Mad Max. I'm so confused. Who was Mad Max?! https://twitter.com/digitalspy/status/653520527810805760 …
Okay, don't get me wrong, I love Furiosa. But I'm absolutely okay with her not appearing in another Mad Max movie. Let me explain:
@LimitedPaper what Im taking away from this is that Furiosa won't be in the Mad Max sequels because she'll be the lead in Furiosa: The Movie
The Next Mad Max Sequel Will Not Star Charlize Theron’s Furiosa http://dlvr.it/CQbM0F 
Are people really surprised that Charlize Theron won't be back for another Mad Max movie? Wasn't her story finished in Fury Road?
Furiosa not being in the next Mad Max movie is big news for fans who have never seen the previous three films.
@jeffspross @petersuderman I don't even want any Mad Max sequels. Can we just get an Imperator Furiosa movie franchise instead?
george miller says furiosa won't be in the next mad max movie, which makes a lot of sense, and also she's getting a prequel movie

Mad Max: Fury Road is a sure favorite. This movie is wow
Director George Miller had his wife, Margaret Sixel, edit "Mad Max: Fury Road" so it wouldn't look like every other action movie.
Charlize Theron is brilliant in Mad Max Fury Road, and the movie is fun. Nice fun. But for me is just that

I just spent hours arguing about Mad Max: Fury Road with @EZSnappin and @BATMANG even though we all liked the movie a lot
"Okay class, today in Driver's Ed we're watching an educational movie." "What movie?" "Mad Max: Fury Road."
Loved the new Mad Max movie: Things are better with women leading & real men are just as strong when they support & work with others.
There's definitely a meeting right now about how Mad Max: Fury Road was successful that DOESN'T involve Furiosa or being an R-rated movie.
An hour into Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome and I'm just realizing there isn't a car in this movie :/
Mad Max Fury Road is a beast of a movie. Freaking BEAST. More please.
So I'm watching this movie that's Mad Max and Zombies or something.

I must be more about story and characters rather than special effects cause Mad Max is still a dull movie to me. Substance > Aesthetics

Just got back from THE MARTIAN. I absolutely loved it. Even though I really enjoyed MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, I think this is 2015's best movie.
Mad max is a great piece of movie
Inside Out is my favourite movie of 2015 followed by Mad Max, Trainwreck & The Voices
"Brothers In Arms" by Tom Holkenborg from Mad Max: Fury Road. This movie is the best thing to happen to me this who… http://spoti.fi/1FcOw1C

Dilemma.................what movie to watch..........Mad Max, Warrior, Inception, Lawless, Child 44 or The Drop or any Tom movie Hmmmm
So...Mad Max: Fury Road was a good movie.
yo mad max fury road is a good freaking movie
I watched Mad Max last night. OMG that movie was so good and Tom Hardy
Cannot get into this Mad Max movie
sorry but this mad max movie is a worthless waste of 2 hours. why is this popular?
Saw Mad Max: Fury Road four times in seven days. What a fucking movie!
Hands down. Mad max beyond the thunderdome is now my favorite movie. Ever.
I'm still so obsessed with Mad Max. It's my belief that it is the best movie released in 2015.
I enjoyed the mad max fury road movie but I don't feel compelled to make fan arts ???

Oh and the movie is over. People just walking around. So Exodus Gods and Kings was like a really crappy Mad Max ripoff movie. No vehicles.

Mad Max is such a crazy good movie. I gotta watch it again.
@Elite_Customs_ @THEJeepMafia after I told @THEJeepMafia to go watch the movie mad max and he hasn't posted anything

Overall, The Martian gets the SECOND 10/10 I've given a movie in 2015, the only other one being Inside Out. Yes, even Mad Max: Fury Road
So… Movie Night! Just rented Mad Max. Despite having 50Gbps, iTunes appears to be using dial up tonight - won’t be ready for 1hr 36 minutes
Waiting for a movie which can affect as much as Interstellar or Age Of Ultron did. Even EVEREST, Mad Max, or The Martian didn't affect me.
Mad Max: Fury Road might just be my top movie of the year holy shit
Mad max is such a weird movie
Mad Max was everything a movie should be.

Mad Max is probably thee best movie
I'm just now getting to see Age Of Ultron & Mad Max: Fury Road… I'm a delinquent cinephile… The last movie I saw in theatres was Godzilla
Mad Max and The Martian are tied for best movie of 2015 imo

Mad Max is honestly such a beautiful movie. Especially the film score ahhh I love it.
everybody better pop out for that "Mad Max" video with me & @Devin_X_ we gon hit yall with the details soon , its gon be a movie
@TheHISHEdotcom The only reason I'll accept for you not having done a Mad Max Fury Road video is that the movie's perfect & there's no need.
2hours non-stop war. I should've watch Mad Max since 5months ago rite? Whatever. The coolest movie this year so far. And the guitar guy tho
'Mad Max' voted best movie of the year by international critics - http://klou.tt/105fargvn3xzx

MAD MAX: FURY ROAD -- the fact that ppl are saying its the best movie of the year just goes to show how low the bar is being set these days.
A few weeks ago I watched every Mad Max movie in order. Now it's time for the Alien series. Not including the Predator ones. 'Cause, meh.

@bryanbehar Hey, I 'shuddered' at the latest Mad Max movie.
After the intro to Mad Max Sarah says, "I need some water I feel like this movie is going to make me thirsty".
God of War 2 remains better than the original. best action game ever. as good as mad max fury road the movie except without furiosa
This new Mad Max movie needs a @RiffTrax treatment in a bad way.
I've seen gay kink porn with less bondage than this new Mad Max movie.
Watched mad max road of fury. Liked the original better. Still a good movie. Lots of special affects.
Mad Max:Fury Road is still the movie of the year. You don't have to understand what I'm saying. Get context first.
Mad max is such an awesome movie everyone in it is just so beautiful and tough as hell
Mad max confusing as shit but a good as movie
also: the mad max game actually is really cool, like exponentially better than you would ever expect from a movie tie-in game
ok its apparently movie marathon night bc tom hardy in dark knight rises made me wanna watch mad max so here we goooOOOO TIME TO SHOUT A LOT
Finally watched MAD MAX FURY ROAD. Solid action movie. Is the plot a bit weepy? Sure. Is the ending flawed? Of course. But oh the vivacity!

@miceliaj have you seen mad max the new movie?
Mad Max is the first movie I finished while sober in a long time. Watch itttttt
Mad Max reminds me of @William_Ruiz64 so much, a bunch of freaks are in this movie !
Of all the movie dates @katiebelle13 & I've had we were quietest during Mad Max. I blame Tom Hardy.
Mad Max is a gorgeous movie sure, but man... the score though
Also Green Inferno is in theaters soon. I'm not a big movie watcher, but the hype is real. Mad Max and Green Inferno.
@Kurt_Gibson_23 honestly it's the best movie of the year. If you have seen the new Mad Max, Black Mass is better
Mad max is already a good movie and it's only 15 minutes in
I am stoked about getting to watch the new Mad Max movie tonight! Only a couple more hours of work to go!
I rented mad max on Amazon prime because I'm weak and I fucking love that movie.

@loophole572 @drgnkiller Mad Max is still considered by many to be the best movie of 2015. Fuck's his thought process on that one?

"Black Mass" was an outstanding movie. Second best I've seen all year behind only Mad Max. Depp's best role in over a decade. Highly rec.
Here’s an interesting movie comparison: WORLD WAR Z w/ MAD MAX: FURY ROAD. WWZ tries for unrelenting, but big action scenes are purposeless.

@kanyewest Yeezy Season 2 is the biggest joke . Ugliest clothes I have ever seen. Wardrobe from a bad movie? Left overs from Mad Max?
Showed five minutes of mad max to my friends and now they want to see the whole movie...the power of Valhalla

So far this Maze Runner 2 movie seems like a mix of The Island + Mad Max + Aliens. Isn't making any sense yet.
Yeezy Season 2 looks like clothes for another Mad Max movie

Watched 1st 15m of new Mad Max movie. I wouldn't have believed it, but they managed to make something dumber than a Fast & Furious movie.
@MarkArum low t is right mad max is great. The guitarist makes the movie.
agree!!! mad max fury also the best movie, but kingsman much better https://twitter.com/TwtLelaki/status/644138001761570816 …
Mad Max Fury Road was edited by someone who had never edited an action movie before lol, and it's still the best action movie this year!
Lots of people chose Kingsman. Me too. It's the best action movie this year besides Mad Max.
This mornings work traffic got me feeling like I'm in a Mad Max movie.

My favorite garage plays the original Mad Max movie on loop in the waiting room. Legit.
@donkeefer I love the Road Warrior its my favourite Mad Max movie.
@jameslikesowls Because Mel IS Mad Max. Dad said the same. It was a great movie but didn't feel like Mad Max - same as we said.
@jameslikesowls Road Warrior, watch that shit. A better Mad Max movie than Fury Road.
@allthewebs Yeah, I need to say that I know not all anarchists are behaving like gangsmembers out of a mad max movie. But there are those
I'm not sure there's a movie with a better score than Mad Max: Fury Road. Just phenomenal!
So this isn't really a good Mad Max movie thus far, but it's really god damned fun!

I take back what I said about mad Max, this movie has no story line. And hour in and you don't know why anything is happening
@MarkoKream I watched that Mad Max: Fury Road movie ! It was full of action, but I thought he could've been a lot better
@RoverRadio Dude, it's Mad Max. Watching any Mad Max movie for the plot is like watching porn for the plot. Who cares?

Mad Max, this movie haiii
Say what? Your favorite movie ever is back in IMAX this week, and it's Mad Max: Fury Road? Hey, that's my fave movie too. Glad we agree.
@TheInternetBG @ItsKickemm Mad Max was a great movie
Mad Max is brilliant but I don't know why this movie makes me so uncomfortable. I have problems watching it and idk why???
Fury Road is maybe my third or fourth favorite Mad Max movie.
People at burning man look like a bunch of extras for a mad max movie
Mad max was dope! Dude literally said nothing in that whole movie haha
So, anyone notice in Mad Max: Fury Road, that it was actually the work of Immortan Joe; the movie's patriarch; that secured the 'good' end?

After watching the SBFP of Mad Max I've basically arrived at the conclusion that a lot of people loved a movie they misunderstood
Ben just beat the Mad Max game. It's neat because it's kind of the plot of the first movie (kind of) set in the Fury Road world. Into it.

The new 'Mad Max' game is the sort of movie-tie in games we need, not directly linked, and great quality. #madmax #avalanchestudios
Mad Max: Fury Road and The Ten Commandments are the same movie. Argue me. It's true.

I love all this fan art for Mad Max. And there's SOOOOO much of it. People are so passionate about this movie. pic.twitter.com/jvSViGp8Oj
you have to check out this movie, its mad max with zombies and it is awesome! Wyrmwood https://youtu.be/i-vJjDHOI3A  http://fb.me/7Al3eDEDC 
So i loved MAD MAX FURY ROAD a lot more the 2nd time. Better experience in the theater but liked it more as a movie after re-watching 8.5/10
it's impossible to imagine the next Mad Max movie not having Imperator Furiosa but sadly that's the only thing that makes sense
The movie I'm watching has all the big boys in it. Rocky, terminator, mad max, the professor
Mad Max was a really good movie it just didn't know when to end
@Zak_Bagans did u watch the new mad max movie? Very little CGI. Good Ole fashion action flick
I heard George Miller spilled some details and in the next movie Mad Max foils a bank robbery.
I just watched mad max and wow what an amazing movie
My ex's boyfriend looks like a half-lifer from the new Mad Max. I love that movie. A lot of them die.
Saw Mad Max Fury Road in IMAX. I am spoiled forever. What can possibly give me a movie high after that?
With the ongoing drought and wildfires, the entire state of California is on its way to become the set for the next Mad Max movie by 2020.

The worst part of Mad Max was that it was only one movie, and not all of the movies at all times.
I really liked MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, but "Best Action Movie Ever Made"? That's praise I'm not ready to bestow.
So I'm getting the Mad Max movie as a get well present from my mom and dad, but I can only have it post surgery. I'm excited!

So on Saturday I watched Mad Max. I did not understand one bit of that movie.
I loved Mad Max Fury Road (it's been the best movie of 2015, and will probably remain that way in my eyes)

I’ve been watching mad max for an hour I have no idea what’s going on and this movie is my worst nightmare
Charlize Theron in Mad Max is still the best part of that movie.
I've seen a ton of people in town from burning man, and I swear to god they all could have roles in the next Mad Max movie.
Old but fucking gold. <3 — assistindo Mad Max - Movie 1979
Asking myself why I started watching the new Mad Max movie with the DKATS...
watching Mad Max with Isaac & Hark. finally! #madmax #furyroad #charlizetheron #tomhardy #movie… https://instagram.com/p/7WsuYaH1Ax/ 
Episode 10 is here! We review maybe the best film of the summer? Mad Max Fury Road https://youtu.be/6xZjqguCGkU  #film #MadMax #FanExpoCan #movie
This Mad Max movie is the weirdest thing I've ever seen
In the movie Mad Max: Fury Road, Max had O-Negative Blood (universal donor). Everyone that was hooked up was a universal donor.
Thing about every Mad Max movie (apart from 1st) is that it's clear that being a badass loner has messed him up - joining a group saves him.
Mad Max: Fury Road is the most beautiful movie I've seen since I saw an old print of Derek Jarman's Blue blow up in the third reel.
Just started Mad Max! Whoo! Heard awesome things about this action flick! #MadMax #movie #chillax
Just watched Mad Max Fury Road for the 4 billionth time. God damn I love that fucking movie!
I personally loved Mad Max. Then again that particular movie isn't for everyone. Maybe that's why reviews are so disparate.
Mad Max is a glorious movie pass it on So in love
Mad Max is a badass movie
One thing that bugs me about Mad Max the game is the movie's praised for important female characters, but the game seems to focus on Max.
@Champ_Yvee ur watching a Viking movie or mad max again?
Finally watched new Mad Max movie. Best movie I've ever seen in which I couldn't understand a goddamned word anyone was saying.
Mad Max: Fury Road: "All this for a family squabble." Hey, so this is a pretty decent movie, huh?
The next Mad Max movie should just be filmed during Burning Man.
Mad Max is the best action movie ever ever seen.
Mad Max: Fury Road is just the most beautifully done action movie. Dat score tho.
Movie night tonight!!!! Staying in watching Mad Max and eating Asian fusion deliciousness!!!! What did you guys... http://fb.me/2d5ogDrkf 
this movie mad max is a tweak lol
mad max was a cool movie I guess but it can't change the fact that I hate the Sand Fight genre which is a very real genre that exists
mad max was a bad movie bruh
Just saw the new "Mad Max." It's a whatever movie. The takeaway: when fossil fuel resources run low, beware of Goths.
Road Warrior feels more like what I expected from a Mad Max movie. Like the first was a proof of concept and the second is final product.
Not even 10 minutes into Mad Max and it's already the weirdest movie I've ever seen....
Mel Brooks should make a parody movie out of Mad Max, and the main villain could be called Immortan Jew.
mad max actually wasn't a bad movie
"I watched the new Mad Max today" "Terrible movie, it was all about Charlize" "The last 20 years has been tough for you, hasn't it?"
Just watched the new Mad Max and was very upset by all of the strong female characters. Where is my man movie?? #sadMax
@hotmanila yup Mad Max Duterte at Edsa - sounds nice - an epic adventure movie
Have you heard about the #Borderlands Movie? No we aren't talking about Mad Max! http://dld.bz/dS4Mx 
My movie choice for my wife and daughter was Mad Max. They didn't like it so now I have to watch it alone with a case of beer!
Mad max is so by far the sickest movie I have ever seen #insane
@CTartsMorley you went into a mad max movie expecting a thinking persons movie 0_o

So last night I was struck by how little Mad Max fit my notion of a Mad Max movie.
Mad Max is a fucked up movie
I think mad max is the worst movie I've ever seen. In my entire life. what. the. heck. is. going. on.
Didn't get to play Mad Max today but did watch the movie so that still count :) recommend everyone to get it.
Saw the new Mad Max movie. That’s basically how I imagine Burning Man.

The Mad Max game is great. Better than the movie that came out earlier in the year because Max actually has a role to play.
I got to pick which movie we gonna watch tonight so I'd go for Mad Max Fury Road. Hope they'd like it
mad max: fury road is just such a good movie
@ItalyGG @Skin_Yard @Polygon yo, thats the metacritic page for mad max the movie...not the game. http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/mad-max  thats for the game
So obsessed with the movie Mad Max. I swear it gets better every time I watch it.

the movie Mad Max is freaking weird
FURY ROAD is new on Blu-Ray & streaming. But if you went to the theater to see it, it might've looked like this: http://www.themovieguys.net/2015/05/25/to-from-movie-review-mad-max-fury-road/ …
Also, OBVIOUSLY, you'd market it like they did Mad Max. LIKE A GENERIC ACTION MOVIE/ANCIENT EPIC.
Polygon was upset that a game called Mad Max, named after a guy from the movie, features a male protag http://archive.is/dWKmu  #GamerGate
FF7 " @NatureUncut: !!! " @AlvanJenkins: Mad max :Fury Road @Emarged: Jurassic World" @Shawnife_: Your favorite 2015 movie so far?"""
Hey remember the time I got so hyped after seeing mad max that I pretended to be the guitar dude from that movie? That was fucking weird
Finally watching Road Fury. Can we name rename the movie Mad Max: Bad Day?
What was your favourite movie of the summer? Some of ours: Jurassic World, Inside Out, Ant Man, Mad Max...
Today I saw Mad Max: Fury Road... Also known as Furiosa and the Goddamned Patriarchy. Great movie!
Die Hard 2 was a loose script for an action movie that they reworked into a die hard film. Mad max feels the same.
Mad Max is such a good movie
Mad Max was such a good movie. I want to watch again, now.

Mad Max is so perfect why did it take me so long to watch this amazing movie
I didn't think I would see a movie this year with more effective dialog than Mad Max, then I saw Shaun the Sheep Movie.
So I finally watched Mad Max, man that was a good movie. The high point in the chase score just left me in awe https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgYnKu8RYAU&t=3m1s …
Mad max fury road is probably the best action movie I've ever seen.
They made a movie about the Psychos from Borderlands. It's called Mad Max Fury Road.
A word of warning to anyone else who wants to tell me that Kingsmen is a good movie, but Mad Max: Fury Road isn't: don't.

{ movies } Mad Max should be released at the end of every summer because there's not a single movie playing that I want to see right now.
Mad Max: Fury Road, no one got to say the title of the movie in the movie, which was kind of shocking, but it was still a great campy movie.
"You just made my eye twitch, Mad Max, that movie was made for us!" My aunt y'all
@BrooklynFagut Mad Max hands down was the best summer movie
The kid from THE BABADOOK would be perfect for a feral child part in a future MAD MAX movie.
Mad Max is such a sickkkkk movie

Current obsession: MAD MAX!!!! Movie was phenomenal. Now I need the game so badly!!!!
Finally watched Mad Max: Fury Road. Great movie but my blood pressure is so high right now. Can't take all those constant explosions & etc.

mad max was a ride from start to finish i could watch that movie all day
Mad Max was pretty sick but it was possibly the weirdest movie I've ever seen
The new Mad Max game is bad because it's largely derivative of a bad school of design tied to a movie largely about throwing off shackles.
Mad Max is a really intense movie _______I almost peed my pants

the best part of mad max is all of the parts that movie is fucking incredible
I will never understand people who say Mad Max: Fury Road had no story or a thin plot. Like, what movie were you watching?
@avantgame haha, what a joke. Can you imagine? "Mad Max Fury Road was a great movie but ultimately it didn't cure death so ... C-."
Finally saw Fury Road. Nifty. My very first Mad Max movie, so forgive me: is the MM universe the most insane, or the *mostest* insanest?

The new mad max is by far the shittiest movie I have ever seen
how is there a movie as metal as Mad Max that's existed for 30+ years and there's not been a single thrash metal concept album about it?????
I absolutely love the new Mad Max movie. BLOWS MY MIND HOW THEY DID THE STUNTS
Mad Max: This was a very different movie from Fury Road until the last act. Then it aaaaaaaaall came together.
Feeling seeing Mad Max Fury Road in the near future. As weird as the movie was it's pretty sick
Bruh mad max has got to be the CRAZIEST movie I've ever seen lol
@oochriso I know a lot of Mad Max fans who are telling other Mad Max fans to skip the latest Mad Max movie. And this game.

Just watched my first movie all summer. Mad Max is awesome. Probably the most "can't look away for a second" movie I've ever seen
Got to see Mad Max Fury Road in 3D tonight and it was the best 3D movie experience I've had. They did this one right.
Yes this is my audition for the next mad max movie pic.twitter.com/Mli2LVl19v
Mad max fury road is easily one of the most manly and yet beautifully artistic and well done movie in a long time.
@skylervmiller How is Donnie Darko your favorite movie?? This is the second time I've seen mad max and it was a million times better
Finally got 2 watch Mad Max Furry Road. Awesome movie & seriously @CharlizeAfrica stole d movie.The guitar guy was hilarious 2 :) #movies
Mad Max was such a good movie.
I finally saw Mad Max: Fury Road - everything I want in a #movie, #feminist ideas and endless, lovingly rendered explosions
I just need to watch Mad Max Fury Road again. I doubt Disney will create an animated movie about a warrior princess in a dystopian world.
After finally watching Mad Max yesterday, I got around to watching It Follows today - also an excellent movie.
There's an alternate universe where Mad Max is the cultural phenomenon I think it is and they make a Mad Max movie every other year
"Mad Max also ties-in with the movie" No it doesn't. Quit saying that shit. Nothing about the game has to do with the movie.
I'm getting drunk by myself & watching mad max because I had to suffer quietly through a bad movie tonight. Im a good person & I deserve it
The new Mad Max was good, but did I miss something? Where did this movie start from? Do I need to rewatch the one before? — watching Mad Max
I'm happy the Fall movie season is here. This summer was disappointing, aside from Mad Max and Ex Machina. Can't wait for Crimson Peak.
I need to watch Mad Max as a pallet cleanser because THE GIFT WAS A BAD MOVIE
Mad Max is my new favorite movie
Mad Max Fury Road was easily the best movie I've ever seen 10/10 highly recommend
