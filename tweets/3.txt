BloodRayne - The Third Reich (2011) --- steer clear of this film! http://goo.gl/fb/1aB55W 
Video game movie ratings should be UweBolls. Similar to degrees for temp. Bloodrayne? 68 UweBolls. SMB? 90 UweBolls. Doom? 88 UweBolls.
LOOOL another bloodrayne movie was made in 2010... Where the fuck was I
Oh no, will The Witcher movie adaptation go down the same failed paths as BloodRayne or Doom? Or something epic: LotR meets Indiana Jones?

So excited for mine and @BrianAlondite's bad horror movie marathon this weekend #BloodRayne #AloneInTheDark #Sharknado
Having a laugh at "Bloodrayne" the movie being R rated. It'd be PG these days.

@JRHWriting As if he's the 1st good actor in a bad movie for a quick buck. Ben Kingsley in Bloodrayne, anybody?
@LouLasher it's been done, actually. Bloodrayne sequel was a western... there was a Billy the Kid vs. Dracula z-grade movie in the 50s.

RIGHT. INTERNET. We've found the Bloodrayne movie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JMqsiWKSiM … YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. I'm off to get booze! @indiespiritbath!
I will say, from what I remember, Bloodrayne 2 wasn't half bad. It was actually somewhat tolerable for a Uwe Bol movie
Gotta see if I can find a copy of Bloodrayne to watch. Every night is video game movie night.
Might be watching the second Bloodrayne movie. Rob Reiner's brother plays a Don Corleone and Igor combination. #uwebollmustbestopped
@jaycgallagher I remember she did a lot of low-rent stuff after, including at least one Uwe Boll movie (Bloodrayne 2, I think?)
@AnthonyKlaz I wonder if i get to fight nazis to in the third movie like he did with Bloodrayne lol
@MrUrbanBuddha I loved BloodRayne. But I'm a b-movie fan.
This week's #MovieMonday is Bloodrayne 2: Deliverance. Do NOT bur or rent this movie, especially if you want to watch a movie sometime.

last Uwe Boll movie i saw was BloodRayne: The Third Reich. it was so bad. it was like watching bad nazis fetish porn.
@BroTeamPill That's what he gets for ruining every kid's dream of seeing a good video game movie #BloodRayne #Postal #AloneInTheDark #FarCry
@DMLFury My mistake, it was the 2nd Bloodrayne movie. But I did ask him about Tunnel Rats.
@ChaosSmurf He is the enemy of gaming. Bloodrayne the Movie could have been so good.
@patrickashe @failnaut That was clear the moment he decided to make the BloodRayne movie
Or he could make another incesty Bloodrayne movie.
@leonmiles_ @CringeChannel ... He made Bloodrayne and the Dungeon Siege movie into trilogies? Color me surprised.

Watch the Nostalgia Critic's review of BloodRayne and... oh my god... I can see why Laura Bailey hates this movie so much.
You know, Amazon UK, just because I want to play BloodRayne, doesn't mean I want to see the shitty movie.
#Bloodrayne still a better movie than #Twilight
Omg that BloodRayne movie was so bad and it had some good actors in it too

2011: horror direct-to-dvd movie BloodRayne: The Third Reich is released. It's loosely based on the BloodRayne video games.
It's official, Hollywood cannot make a decent B-movie. "Bloodrayne: The Third Reich" v. "Blade", give it up, chumps.
"Bloodrayne" (2006) is an inane movie (F) #DallasCritic <n87bq5>
IDK, the more I think about this Bloodrayne movie, compared to "Blade", the more I like it.

Jason Kidd wanting to be GM after winning 5 playoff games is like Uwe Boll wanting to direct the next Hunger Games movie after BloodRayne.

I didn't think it was possible to make a worse movie than BloodRayne 2 until I saw From Dusk Til Dawn 3. :( These things cannot be unseen.
Was Ben Kingsley the only one not high during the production of BloodRayne the Movie? Holy shit that was bad! Looking forward to part 2 & 3!
@Angelheartnight @GamingAnarchist That movie and Bloodrayne really made me hate video game movies.
Today is crap movie and house cleaning day. Today I have crap movies playing on the laptop as I clean this pigsty! First up: BloodRayne!
@filmsack If yall weren't sure what was your worst movie for the show, I think it was either Hardware or Bloodrayne. Remember those two? lol
OK, so the Bloodrayne movie has Michael Madsen, Michelle Rodriguez and MEAT LOAF, AND THEY STILL MANAGED TO FUCK IT UP

@GrudgeReinhold Brule-esque typo in there to boot. movie tip for you: Bloodrayne. Zane & Madsen are two highlights
@Avi_Gaming @JPSalamanca Bloodrayne movie was meh. House of the Dead was worse! lol.
@Irishlover20 yea...he was amazing in Freddy vs Jason and then in the second bloodrayne movie.
@clarkgregg @IMBrettDalton @ChloeBennet4 @Lil_Henstridge @ElleSatine Haven't seen a gift like that since the BloodRayne movie.

it's hard to take people who say "This movie is an awful piece of shit" seriously when I've seen the Bloodrayne movie.
. @BillyZane you almost save BloodRayne from being the worst movie I've ever seen, but not quite.
I'm having another video game movie day at my place and had to pick up Bloodrayne. It felt like buying a porno: sweaty palms, black bag, etc

BloodRayne, the movie, may have blew but how the hell did Uwe Boll assemble a cast as stacked as he did? Kingsley? Madsen? Zane? Meatloaf!?!

"BloodRayne" (2006) is a disagreeable movie (D+) #AhiMovieReviews (May 10, '13)
Well Bloodrayne 3 was... a movie. That's all I can say about it. Also, it took three movies to get to the games initial premise?
There's a BloodRayne movie? I am both interested and disgusted all at the same time. I threw up in my mouth, then swallowed it.
"Bloodrayne 3" might be the only movie I've seen where Michael Pare looks so ashamed of himself for being part of it. That says a lot.
. @BenALeonard Very. And to think that we used to had to slough through Bloodrayne: The Movie and The Shadow to get here.
@MarkedWardWard this second BloodRayne movie has a pretty decent set. almost makes up for the lack of actors, script, and overall direction.
The name of the movie is "bloodrayne" #LT
They got a "BloodRayne" movie.....wow I remember playing the game yrs ago.
The movie BloodRayne: The Third Reich on Netflix is basically a softcore porno. What the hell.
Bloodrayne 3 is a fucking awful awful movie. There is nothing good about it. Even the lesbian scenes are shite.
@kevharb Of course it was Uwe Boll. The 3rd Bloodrayne movie. I've never made it through any of them.
Bloodrayne: The Third Reich. Hmm, I think more vampire franchises could benefit from this idea. Pity this movie is so very bad.

@jsnell @blankbaby @lschmeiser @theincomparable may I recommend the bad movie podcast begin with BLOODRAYNE: THE THIRD REICH
@filmsack So what's the verdict? Was Bloodrayne worse than Hardware? I hated Hardware but loved the sack where you all ripped that movie up.
I think the script for this Bloodrayne movie was actually the screenwriter's suicide note. #itssobad
I'm watching Bloodrayne the Third Reich. Holy shit this movie sucks. Someone greenlit this travesty #icantlookaway
Bloodrayne the worst vampire movie eva
@filmsack Dear Lord! Bloodrayne is a horrible movie. Can't wait to hear the podcast.
There was a SEQUEL to Uwe Boll's Bloodrayne movie? I'm not sure I want to live in this world anymore.
@filmsack BloodRayne. A movie so bad it killed Kristana Loken's chance at a career.
An incredibly terrible movie. Thanks @filmsack http://is.gd/x4eUWB  #GetGlue #BloodRayne
BloodRayne did not make the best movie. It was okay, but eh. Apparently the game is better, and I believe that.
In other news, whichever Bloodrayne movie this is is lousy.

Spend Super Bowl Sunday and have an Uwe Boll movie Marathon and call it Super Boll. Start with Bloodrayne. Ugh.... Horrible idea. Go NINERS.
@scottEweinberg BloodRayne 3 was his best movie that I'd seen & it wasn't that good. Probably his most competent for what that's worth.

This movie would be made about fifty gazillion times better simply by being more aware of how utterly ridiculous it is. #bloodrayne
They made a *third* Bloodrayne movie. THERE HAVE BEEN THREE BLOODRAYNE MOVIES AND NO WONDER WOMAN MOVIE.
Wait what is this a moody WWII European art house movie on The Movie Channel? No it's just BloodRayne: The Third Reich.
Bloodrayne movie not highly recommended afterall.
The Bloodrayne movie has the perfect sort of campy gore. Feels like it was torn right out of the 90s. Highly recommended.
“@linalovebugg: Bloodrayne is such a terrible movie. I'm mad I wasted my time. Smh.” Yeah nothing like the game.

I was just watching a Bloodrayne movie and was admiring the Nazi uniforms lol
At this point I'd like to ask.. why does the opening of the Bloodrayne nazi movie go on for like 5 minutes?
Wow... even though this movie has a half human nazi killing vampire, it was still pretty horrible. http://bit.ly/WXPzbX  #GetGlue #Bloodrayne
Bloodrayne (The Movie) Has Objectively Good Qualities
as part of our newly started weekend vampire movie marathons (we exhausted zombies) @jaxxepps & i are watching the TERRIBLE “bloodrayne” …
Bloodrayne really should have been left just a game lol, come to think of it has there been 1 successful video game movie?
Silent hill is th dumbest movie based on a game next to bloodrayne.
They did a 3D conversion of the first Bloodrayne movie. I'm sure that just looks delightful.
What was the last movie you watched that was really good?... — Well it sure as hell wasn't Bloodrayne. http://ask.fm/a/1cgjkk2m 
"Guten tag, motherfuckers". THIS MOVIE HAD NO PLOT. AT ALL. NOTHING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WAS MADE. #BloodRayne
You know what's not good? This movie. #BloodRayne
Sooo this BloodRayne movie is terrible. My family comes by to support me but instead hijack my tv and put terrible things on.
I can't believe Michael Madsen is in this movie #BloodRayne! It's weird to see 'Sonny Black' dressed in medieval clothes. #BadIdea
Watched “BloodRayne” tonight. It was atrocious. “Moby Dick 2010” was a better movie. I’m serious.
Stop me from clicking "play" on this Bloodrayne movie. Please, Internet, I beg you.

Bloodrayne is such a brilliant movie HAW-HAW
Bloodrayne is an appalling movie, it's only saving grace is the lack of sparkliness in the vampires.
I Don't Know WHY But I Have The Sudden Urge To Watch "Bloodrayne" Even Though The Movie Blows.
Everytime I see someone say "the worst movie I've ever seen", I automatically think, "Well, they obviously haven't seen Bloodrayne.'

About to kick off the Halloween movie-fest with Bloodrayne. Going to have to stop myself from trying to cut Matt's hair through the screen.
Only saw the first 15 minutes out of curiosity, but what they say is true... BloodRayne really is the worst movie ever made. #fb

Having a beer, doing some dumbells & watching bloodrayne 2. The latter is an embarrassingly bad movie. Love it ;D
WAIT WAIT WAIT. NEW OUTRAGE. Uwe Boll, perpetrator of such films as Bloodrayne and Alone in the Dark, is making a Holocaust movie.
What was the worst movie you've ever seen? — Bloodrayne 2 xxx http://4ms.me/cRKNsF
Similarly horrifying: Uwe Boll still has a career, and the Bloodrayne movie is on the verge of spawning a *second* sequel (direct to DVD).

Tonight Crystal and I will be grabbing a bottle of wine and watching the Bloodrayne movie. Possibly the worst idea ever.
Just watched Rampage by Uwe Boll I have to say his best movie I've seen house of the dead, alone in the dark and Bloodrayne Wich were bad ..

@jdinseattle Oh God... We tried to watch BloodRayne last night on @instant_netflix. Horrible movie.

There is a third Bloodrayne movie being made. The title? Bloodrayne: The Third Reich, of course.

i know what the next gen consoles need... a third BLOODRAYNE game, and while they are at it get rid of Uwe Boll & make a decent movie of it.
How the hell did Bloodrayne get such an amazing cast when it is such a craptastic movie?
thinkin bout downloadin BloodRayne... havent seen that movie in FOREVER and i kinda wanna watch it but idk...
What's your fave video game movie? Not gonna lie, mine's BloodRayne.

@FilmSnobbery disappointed there was no Lesbian Vampire Killers or BloodRayne on your favourite Vamp movie list :P
Bloodrayne is a fucking horrible movie....the best part was rayne sex scene she has nice boobs
Also in today's comics: video game and movie favorite BloodRayne.
@zomb1etron I've seen all of the game/movie ones bar Far Cry and Bloodrayne 2.
Raptor Island was the worst movie I've ever watched. Much worse than Bloodrayne, Postal or even House of the Dead. It was great fun though!
I think that this is the first time I have ever seen almost all of Bloodrayne. The video game would have made a better movie.
Watching bloodrayne on syfy Channel.. Movie is not good.. Gonna go make breakfast.
How to make a Bloodrayne movie: don't get Uwe Boll to direct, and pick a better game.

Bloodrayne is pretty much the worse movie I have seen this year.

right, time for a bath, finally found BloodRayne!!! so it's homework and cheesy movie, i likes!
watching Bloodrayne , i love vampire movie and shows like , angel, van hesling,and others , I.m me if u do 2.
This Movie Bloodrayne was sooo fucking corny I feel sad for anyone that saw this in theaters
Saw the Bloodrayne movie the other day. I wonder what the point of it was. No wit, no heat, just lots of gore and a diffuse war-movie plot.
About to watch bloodrayne for the first time. I know it's a Cleveland steamer of a movie but I just gotta watch it.

BloodRayne on SyFy, after watching TANG.... can't stop laughing... It's so silly. and thanx to Uwe Boll another video game movie gone wrong
First Serenity and now Bloodrayne, twwo of my fave worlds (unfortunately the movie suxs), but a great way to end a fab weekend!!
It *is* Shitty Vampire Movie Sunday on SyFy! I was right! (though "Perfect Creature" isn't shitty. Seriously. But "Bloodrayne" is next!)
After watching Dead or Alive, Super Mario Brothers and Bloodrayne, Doom seems a really good movie.
This just in: Dack watches a lot of bad movies, and he loves Uwe Boll, especially the second BloodRayne movie.
Watched five minutes of Bloodrayne, and turned it off. Uwe Boll is a complete hack and should never be allowed to make another movie!
Dragonball Evolution is probably the most god awful movie I have ever seen. I think bloodrayne was better...
Controversial director Uwe Boll is behind our movie on Sat 22:55, BloodRayne. The sequel BloodRayne 2: Deliverance is on Sun at same time
@mcvane That is scary- I just came across Alone in the dark 2 and another bloodrayne movie. Sad thing they r not hokey or a cure 4 insomnia
Despite the beer's influence, I still recommend never watching Bloodrayne 2. A total lack of tits makes it the lamest Uwe Boll movie yet.

@alisonhaislip also battling for worst movie, Dragon Wars & Bloodrayne. Bloodrayne wins tho, so wrong, so very wrong
Time for the worst movie in my collection, Bloodrayne, it is just the time of the evening i guess.
Week three of the 2009 Movie Challenge and we have drawn out movies based on video games. Last night endured "Bloodrayne". 0/5!!!!
@jwish I think Warcraft will bomb just like Bloodrayne.. It won't work good as a movie, imo.
Chillin in my room watching Bloodrayne. Best vampire movie that I have ever seen.
whats worse? Scarlett Johansson keeping covered up in a saucy movie scene or the idea that Bloodrayne movies are continuing to be made!!!!!!
@brutallegend Bloodrayne the movie is definitely #NotMetal (watching it right now)
@ToplessRobot Reminds me of the BloodRayne movie. To which THEY MADE A SEQUEL WHY GOD WHY?!
just had a bad vidieo game movie night, rented bloodrayne 2, DOA, and the original street fighter, dead or alive is my new fav movie
The worst movie's I have ever seen- Toss up between Transformers 2 and Bloodrayne, What are the worst movies you have ever seen?
Zombie love? Christ, this is the stupidest movie I have ever seen. Possibly stupider than Bloodrayne, and that's saying something.
20 min in and Bloodrayne is the best movie i've ever seen
will this movie sink lower then Bloodrayne 1 & 2? Same director I believe so could be a close call
@xliliax @NickyBlaklen i just coughed, and well if i was talking 'bout a bad vampire movie, it would be bloodrayne, but if the shoe fits...
I think I'll watch Surf's Up. Yes, a kid's movie. A colleague loaned it to me, so I should watch it eventually. Besides, it's not Bloodrayne
@NoelClarke u telling me Pepsi have employed the same ppl that R responsible 4 Mama Mia the movie & Bloodrayne 2 2 come up w/ drinks?
@DrWicked SPICE WORLD is my favorite scary movie ever. And BloodRayne 2 is missing from the list; it (arguably) is a crime against humanity.
Watching BloodRayne movie. So far, crap :P
BloodRayne is great movie. It is just a really, really, really great movie.
next movie: "Bloodrayne."
Do I go to bed? Don't have to be up untill 8.30! And I have a vampire movie called BLOODRAYNE 2 on bluray? Faith no more kicked ass !!!
now "BloodRayne" i didn't much like this movie when i 1st saw it, but i'm gunna give it another try. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383222/
30 days of night is the 2nd worst vampire movie I've seen, still not as bad as Bloodrayne 2 tho.
@madlyv Hi, Virginia. Saw your bro in a movie last night, "BloodRayne" think it was. Is he that intense in person? In "real" life?
bloodrayne? awsome movie
There is nothing better than an Uwe Bole movie to waste a Saturday afternoon. except an Uwe Bole sequel that is. That's right Bloodrayne 2!
chick in the bloodrayne movie....kinda hot....movie sucks ass....I wonder how many people watch the crap movie for the hot chick?
watching the incredible movie that is Bloodrayne....*eye roll*...and making lunch
So I decided to keep going with Netflix on demand and watch BloodRayne; I feel robbed. It takes serious talent to make a movie *that* bad.
You know, this movie is really calling to attention the fact that the weapons of Bloodrayne are really impractical
Today the Cavalcade will be live-blogging Bloodrayne (2006) off netflix streaming. Yes, we finally have the guts to show a Uwe Boll movie.
bloodrayne is the worst vampire movie ever. their vampires were a rip off of the buffy tv show from being "dusted" to their face changing.
is watching Bloodrayne II: Deliverance. Blood dribbling + corset-y boobs = best scene ever. (from first movie, not 2nd, lol)
Bloodrayne (the "movie") was beyond awful. Netflix Watch Instantly is still cool.
Finally got around to watching ‘BloodRayne’. A seemingly B grade movie whose only redeeming quality was all the excessive gore. 3 out of 5.
Bloodrayne was a terrible movie, so explain to me why a sequel was made & more importantly WHY am I watching it?!?!
I never doubted it, but good lord the Bloodrayne movie is teeeeerrible
gonna watch bloodrayne now - last movie for the w/e along with some nice sarmies... chillin' way to end a sunday.
Why is the movie BloodRayne on the Zone Horror channel? It's shit, it should be on the Zone Crap Channel. :)
Just found Bloodrayne on tv. Finally get to see how bad this movie is.
Bloodrayne 2 has got to be the dumbest movie I have ever turned on. Nothing clever, just plain awful.
Watching a crappy movie called BloodRayne II: Deliverance on the SCI-FI channel. My my what a way to spend a Sunday.http://twitpic.com/3m15i
watching bloodrayne. only good thing about the movie kristanna loken
I'm watching Bloodrayne and I completely agree with Erica; she could have made a better movie in her toilet. This thing is AWFUL!
EVERYONE HAS LIED TO ME. The Bloodrayne movie is awesome!
Watching Bloodrayne....wow, this movie is atrocious.
I am watching the worst movie (yes i include anything by jennifer aniston) BloodRayne and I cant look away!!
Words cannot begin to describe how infinitely horrible the movie "Bloodrayne" is, and yet I can't stop watching it...
Watching bloodrayne with the sissons. Jesus christ this movie is horrible
Added a new movie to the site: "BloodRayne" http://tinyurl.com/cvnfws
Anyone ever seen the movie 'BloodRayne'? How was it?
@BloodRayne_br that's the best part of The movie!
@paulapoundstone Oh I know you're not kidding. It was probably the worst vampire movie I've ever seen. And that includes BloodRayne.
Is on sick leave at home and watches Bloodrayne. Meat Loaf seems to be the only one who knows what movie he's in, and acts accordingly.
been a pretty blah day. tonight is just me and a movie... possibly bloodrayne
Seen where Uwe Ball made Far Cry The movie, & Seen where BloodRayne 3: Warhammer is Coming out, Hope its not a Disappointment Like the rest
Bloodrayne was the 1st movie I ever laughed openly AT while watching at in a theater. (I have a really low standard for movies)
For such a cast, Bloodrayne the movie is pretty bad.
bon allez c est décidé ce soir c est bloodrayne 2 teh movie
We watched Bloodrayne last night. Deliberate choice of bad movie so we could mock it. And it was *bad*.
@jephjacques dunno if you read these, but if you want a REALLY bad movie check out Bloodrayne. I can't say anything that'll prepare you.
BloodRayne movie: "The movie was criticized for not having much of a story, and for hiring prostitutes to reduce production costs." haha wut
Max Payne = WORST VIDEO GAME MOVIE EVER!!! Yes, I am including Mairo Bros and Bloodrayne in that comparison. BAD BAD BAD!
@MichaelTurk - Have to agree: BloodRayne is the worst movie ever made from a video game. Scrapes all the way through the barrel's bottom.
I liked Resident Evil, but I have to go with Tomb Raider as the best video game movie. Worst had to be Bloodrayne. I couldn't finish it.
What's the worst movie you've ever seen? Tops on my list are Bloodrayne and "The Keep." (Could see the zipper on the monster's suit.)
watching the greatest movie ever on scifi...Bloodrayne...oh the agony.
Watching BloodRayne for shits. My first Uwe Boll movie and his directing reputation proves true. What a horrible, horrible director.
netflix streaming is a problem. they have tremor's 1, 2, and 3, as well as bloodrayne 1 and 2. i see future bad movie marathons!
BloodRayne 2 ... wasn't enough. It seemed like it could just be a tv episode ... not movie worthy, but it has potential ...
Then again, the nicest thing you can probably say about "Bloodrayne" (the movie) is that at least it has video game-grade dialogue.
@triciahonea Bloodrayne 2?? Where she fights Billy the Kid and his army of killer vampires??? Best movie ever.
I think this movie on scifi is Bloodrayne. But not sure.
Watching the Bloodrayne movie on SciFi; how does Herr Boll get awesome actors in his crappy movies?
@helloheath Mine as well be miss "blood" red hair either that or I'll put you in the starring role of the third "bloodrayne" movie HAH!
Omg bloodrayne movie is soooooo bad. And not in a good way.
Doing research on movie soundtracks and found Uwe Boll MADE A SEQUEL TO BLOODRAYNE. This is scary. Really, darn scary.
For tonight's horror movie I reach into my home library and pull out Bloodrayne 2: Deliverance http://ping.fm/FIUGf
holy crap there was a bloodrayne 2 movie? ugh.
Half-vampire BloodRayne rides into Deliverance for a showdown with Billy the Kid and his army of vampire cowboys. Best movie premise ever.
LOL. Zack Ward (Scut Farcus from Christmas Story) is in this movie...I'm done with bloodrayne 2.
The resturant im in has a tv tuned to the SciFi channel, which is showing the movie Bloodrayne. Do these people want to make me hurl?
I asked her to get a zombie or vampire movie, she got me bloodrayne... A movie based on a game... this can't be good
@saronia Uwe Boll is a movie director he did the Bloodrayne movies
Bloodrayne 2 is on Sci Fi channel today. Good time to try our 24 hour podcast movie commentary. No wait, I don't wish that movie on anyone.
@SnowBear I've suffered through Bloodrayne. I don't think any new footage is going to give that movie any help.
I can't help but giggle when I see a "Director's Cut" for a completely worthless movie.. Bloodrayne. Really?? *titter*
@niczak Bloodrayne is still in my book the worst movie ever.. that which all other bad movies are compared, and consistently fall short.
Thursday night movie night...and since I didn't wanna see BloodRayne: Deliverance on the SciFi Channel, I'm catching Iron Man.
Good gravy, Bloodrayne is a horrible movie. I heard bad things but wanted to see for myself. I'm sorry I did. :x
About to watch Bloodrayne, the movie. I hope it's as bad as it looks.
bloodrayne movie made no sense should I tourture myself with the sequel on scifi?
Tonight's 9:00 movie on The Most Dangerous Night of Television is BloodRayne II: Deliverance. No. Just...no. I have standards.
I am re-realizing what a bad movie BloodRayne is... too lazy to hunt for a good DVD. How lazy is that?
BloodRayne may be the worse movie since Ed Wood's films... deliciously so because it tries so hard and falls so short
Bloodrayne 2( the movie) is horrible...
Movie time.. Watching bloodrayne 2
dear uwe boll, considering how badly bloodrayne the movie did... what would posess you to make TWO more bloodrayne movies?!
@giannii usually, you can bet a uwe boll movie is going to be extremely bad, so bad it's almost good. bloodrayne = no exception :)
In memory of Joe, I decided to give BloodRayne a peek on Skiffy...wow, Joe wasn't kidding about this movie.
Guns: ok (for a bad movie). Reform School Girls: better than Bloodrayne, but not good.
Watching the BloodRayne 2 movie.
Why did I jump straight into "Epic Movie" after "Bloodrayne 2"? Will I ever learn?
watching BloodRayne, wondering which scene was the "re-shoot after realizing the movie made no sense" (only 1??)
Keeerist, Bloodrayne 2 is even worst than the first! I didn't think it would be possible to make a CRAPPIER Bloodrayne movie & no nudity!!
New post: Bloodrayne: A Vampire Movie That Sucked ( http://tinyurl.com/2asqnh )
Got 20 min. into "Bloodrayne" movie before it got so bad I stopped Tivo-ing it. bad bad bad

Jack and Jill had a budget of 75 Million. that movie looks like it had 2 Million actually invested into the movie

@ThisAntGuy JACK AND JILL WAS STUPID AND WEIRD. LIKE HE PLAYED THE WHOLE MOVIE HIMSELF BASICALLY. "Shut it, Steve!"
Ok #Sharknado3, "Jack and Jill" was also a terrible movie and they're aren't 3 of them!

i lost my virginity while watching adam sandlers movie "jack and jill"
apparently pixels is sandler's "laziest movie yet" which uh how do you do worse than jack and jill
Jack and Jill is the most racist movie since Birth of a Nation"
Read a review this morning saying Pixels is Sandler's worse movie since Jack and Jill. Not sure if I should take that as a challenge or not.
People are gonna shit on Pixels, but at this point, any Sandler movie is better than Jack and Jill.
Jack and Jill is without a doubt the worst Adam Sandler movie I've ever seen

Jack and Jill with Adam sandler is absolutely the worst movie ever & it's not even debatable whoever let him do that movie should be killed
On a scale of 1-10 Jack and Jill is such a bad movie
The only funny part of Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill is when you realize that someone actually thought this movie sounded like a good idea.
All time favorite Adam Sandler movie? Probably Jack and Jill
I'm so happy Jack and Jill is on TV. It's an Adam Sandler classic, if not, an American classic movie.
I love the movie Jack and Jill
On a side note, this Pixels movie looks like the stupidest film Adam Sandler's ever released. And he starred in Jack & Jill as Jack AND Jill
I think 'Jack and Jill' is not a bad movie because Katie Holmes is the supporting actress. But the rest of it? Bleeerghhh
Jack and Jill is one of my favorite movies even though it won a worst movie of all time award #confessionnight

Midnight movie : Jack and Jill
Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water. Jack fell down, broke his crown and it was still funnier than Adam Sandler's movie.
Adam Sandler is my favorite actor/comedian. He made one bad movie and everyone swears he fell off @ Jack and Jill.
Jack and Jill is even more of a piece of shit movie than a movie that's just a shot of a piece of shit
if you have to buy someone you dislike a christmas present buy them jack and jill, that awful movie where adam sandler plays all the people

Everything ends badly with me... Why. On the bright side I'm watching Jack and Jill. I enjoy this movie.
Grown Ups 2 was by far the worst movie I have ever seen. ZERO laughs. At least Jack and Jill had the Al Pacino commercial at the end.
there's this movie 'Jack and Jill' and Johnny Depp is in it and he is wearing a shirt with Justin on it omg
I cannot believe "Jack and Jill" is in the $5 movie bin. That is just such an insult. I mean who is going to spend $5 on that movie?
Adam Sandler, who played two roles in the Jack and Jill movie, was awarded Golden Raspberry as both the worst actor and the worst actress.
@lukevalmurray I'd genuinely rather watch that movie about a car wheel that kills people then jack and Jill
What is going on, Steve Buscemi and Dustin Hoffman joining Adam Sandler in a movie? My #JackandJill world view is jilted.
