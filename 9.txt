Fight Club explained the fragility of masculinity in this day and age perfectly. That movie was flawless.
Fight Club will forever be my favorite movie
I watched a movie Fight Club Just right to feel pic.twitter.com/EyQxTS5zlY
I forgot how great of a movie Fight Club is
If the movie Fight Club doesn't make you want to change your life than nothing ever will.
Hate promoting violence but for some reason I can't help to love the movie fight club!
So I watched Fight Club and I'm left with one question ... Why is this movie so beloved? It was OK, but I wouldn't watch it again ...
The first rule of Fight Club is tell everyone about this great movie!

You could still shut-off with Fight Club at least, if you didn't wanna look into the "depth" of the movie, you didn't need to.
"But like, do you get the point of the movie?" I get asked this about Fight Club and Donnie Darko a fucking lot when in discussion groups.

Chuck Palahniuk, author of Fight Club, likes the movie better than the book.

What movie inspires you? — Either Star Wars or Fight Club. Depends on my mood http://ask.fm/a/ch1142gq 
God I fucking love this movie. Fight Club is my jam. Its how me and @SpykeTheBassist became friends. Its probably the reason I'm HYDRA.

if you like computers/technology and/or liked the movie fight club. please do yourself a favor and start watching Mr Robot. Seriously.
If you're a male between the ages of 25-40 and don't think Fight Club is a top 3 movie all time, I can't help you.
i love Mr Robot so far but I've noticed so many similarities to Fight Club and now they actually take a song straight from the movie

So I'm watching Fight Club and tell me why it's set up almost like The Machinist, I'm calling it rn the whole movie is one big trip
#MrRobot is entirely too much like the movie Fight Club. So Elliot is Edward Norton & his Dad is Brad Pitt....hmmmm. So who else isn't real?

I'm not sure what my favorite movie is. Whenever I'm asked, I always respond with The Royal Tenenbaums, Fight Club or Being John Malkovich.
To my mind, Fight Club screwed up movie storytelling. It made lying to your audience about your protagonist for most of the film somehow ok.

Why is shawshank redemption rated so highly by everyone it was so fuckin shit, feel like I must've watched the wrong movie
@EmilyBaucum yeah that movie is definitely one you stop down for. Shawshank Redemption stopped me in my tracks earlier.
Sometimes when I see how old a movie suddently is, if feels SO wrong. Independence Day (1996), Shawshank Redemption (1994). 20 YEARS!
Reading Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption makes me realize how over rated the movie was. You are one genius @StephenKing
Finally watched The Shawshank Redemption. Can't believe I deprived myself over 20 years from that movie. Joins Braveheart at the top!
Letting The Shawshank Redemption roll as I work. I never get tired of this movie.

City of God still remains my All time best Gangster movie after the Godfather.
@Lord_Arse I've never watched any of the Godfather movies. You should watch Jurassic Park mate it's an excellent movie
Gregory Polanco's favorite movie is Godfather III
Then the Godfather stared at his space mom when she floats in a movie. He is sad that his livejournal was deactivated
i think it would be a hoot if someone took a popular movie.. and dubbed it in scottish.. like.. the godfather.. goodfellas...
@people I would love to see a current GODFATHER & Goodfellas type of movie with Johnny Depp, Robert D, George Clooney, etc#SexyGina
Al Pacino really has two of the most unexpected slaps in movie history. 1 in Scarface and the other in Godfather 2.
"The Godfather is the GREATEST movie ever made." "why?" "..Because I heard a bunch of other people else say that and I want to fit in. :("
'The godfather' is such a compelling story /movie.
Watching this entire game was worse than watching the 4th Indiana jones movie, aliens 3, die hard 5, godfather part 3, and greese 2
Godfather Part Three? More like Godfather Fart Pee. (Not a good movie: fart and pee are generally considered bad by general public)
The feeling of tension I get from the dinner scene in The Godfather is still unnerving even after seeing this movie fifteen times.
Watching the godfather for the nth time, thanks to my grewtworks prof! Hands down the best movie of all time!
Some people are saying gh is ripping off the godfather movie Well that movie is my fave of all time Gh needs to do it right & they prob will

@evamariasaralyn @JudyAnn_67 OMG, I didn't know Marlon Brando sang in a movie musical! The Godfather singing, did he dance 2? Fantastic!
@SketchesbyBoze Actually, The Godfather is a really good movie, but I've given up recommending my really weird favorites.
@SketchesbyBoze "What's your favorite movie?" "The New World." "Huh?" "Babette's Feast? Ordet? *sigh* The Godfather." "Oh, I love that!"

Not friends with @denofgeek today because they were mean about U.H.F. That movie is my Godfather Part II.
@davidlsims @zinoman Godfather was an unexpected hit though. It wasn't supposed to be the number one movie ever.
@HardyBruh the godfather or if you want a more modern funny movie watch Get Hard
Like I liked him On the Waterfront and the clips of The Godfather I've seen but he was off for me in Streetcar and this movie too
Al Pacino The God Father blew me away. For a movie made in 1972, it was amazing. 1st time watching it, definitely wont be the last

Godfather 3 is far from a bad movie it's just that 1 and 2 were that damn good.
@pbowden Heat is my favorite Godfather movie.
I feel like it's the popular opinion to say Godfather 3 is a bad movie. It really isn't a bad movie at all.
It was the culmination of the first Godfather movie. Damn. https://instagram.com/p/5x0bCNollqPO_fJpB8k1DBv9WN78MGO6W7sLo0/ …

The Godfather is the best movie I've ever seen, literally all life lessons in it.
Godfather Part II is on, and I just walked in on the part where Fredo is being killed. Best movie ever.

“: 8. Quote this with the name of your favourite movie.” The Godfather
President Obama’s favorite movie is The Godfather.
The Godfather is a different type of movie than Goodfellas. It's fiction. Goodfellas actually happened. Puts it in a class by itself.
" @mrkazlaljee A bit harsh" ;-)But fair-only gangster movie I think comes close to Godfather is Un prophète -French film. Bit Papillon too.
I think one of the best arguments for Goodfellas>Godfather is that it's not glamorous, that as fun as the movie is you don't wanna be mafia
