The 3D movie on the Vatican was amazing today at the Whitaker Center
Let me guess, he couldn't get a screening for the School Idol Movie in the Vatican so he went to the US.
I saw yesterday the movie The Vatican Tapes and for a horror movie I never laugh so much.You cant compare it with the old movie The Exorcist
Movie Idea: The Pope visits America for the weekend and his son throws an epic house party at the Vatican #ProjectV
New movie idea.... the Vatican is really a front for vampire hunters on a mission from god throughout the ages. Screenplay in the works!

#Movies: The new movie debunking @Scientology is presumptuous, as if. Ever heard of The @Vatican? #Religions r a form of control & fleecing.
If that new Apple TV can beat people, I’ll be impressed. “That movie with a nun and a thief at the Vatican with the insane billionaire”.
the amount of history in rome is amazing! julius caesar/the lizzie mcguire movie/the vatican etc.

The Vatican acts as if Hollywood stuck to a book's plot every time they made a movie except this time.... http://fb.me/6AM6G6D6c 
The Vatican newspaper has called the Noah movie "a lost opportunity." Well put. Yet it creates an opportunity to revisit the original.
The vatican newspaper slams the 'Noah' movie sayin it "ignores god" says the ones that systematically changed his image! #BlackChrist
Vatican slams Noah movie as 'lost opportunity' that ignores God http://gu.com/p/3zbmj/tw  We always look to the Vatican for its film reviews
http://bit.ly/1sLdkXt  No blessing from the Pope on the Hollywood Movie "Noah". The Vatican says it is a movie without God.
@Kilsally @GdnBelief Oh dear, is the Vatican upset it wasn't afforded centre stage in that movie lol :-)
The Vatican strongly criticized the new movie NOAH....im guessing it wasnt because the whole premise and story line is false and impossible!
That movie Jumper; if I could jump I'm totes going to the Vatican Archives, dawg.
@anitambyrne 2001: Space Odyssey, the greatest movie ever made! Did you know it's on a list of movies officially approved by the Vatican?
Photo: And of course the “Noah” movie has a massive ad right next to the Vatican. Bahaha. http://tmblr.co/Zx6dQy1CM38HW 
The Vatican & the church say #SonOfGodMovie is not a Christian movie; & asks Christians not to go see it
@StackChristian No pronouncements have been made by the Vatican even if the movie is in all likelihood theologically wanting.
Why is the Vatican against "The son of God" movie? http://christianity.stackexchange.com/q/27168?atw=1  #catholicism
Best line of the movie, "how many ppl work for the #Vatican? About half of them!" Hahaha #johnxxiii
Today I fangirled so much when I went to the Vatican and when I went to la Fontana di Trevi bc I remembered Lizzie Mcguire's movie lol
@DKsMum @Movie_Nut93 I think you're missing the Vatican, heard the pope loves those films.
@TheBatman8852 The movie dude, seriously? You know the Vatican AND Muslim religions have condemned the movie? http://article.wn.com/view/2014/03/12/Christians_join_Muslims_in_condemning_Russell_Crowes_new_mov/ …

@Mimi_0723 @AmandaMuchx3 we are going to see that movie! I promise we have to and after we can go cleanse ourselves at the Vatican
Would have been a great movie had they got there. 'German Customs Seize Cocaine Headed To The Vatican In 14 Condoms' http://www.sickchirpse.com/german-customs-seize-cocaine-vatican/ …
My initial reaction to any time I see the Vatican (tv or movie), is to hiss like a cat. I know you, I know you're evil, and I want you dead.
I feel like there's a movie script in the story about the Vatican digitising its library. Sort of Da Vinci code/Omen/Ghost Busters #BadMovie

In the Vatican today, met with some people from the upcoming Noah movie they really want to prove to me that it is legitimate
I dare say some of the images on the 300 movie are reminiscent of the masterpieces I saw at the Vatican. Artistic. Poetic
was watching this movie with my bf about the Vatican vs. the illuminati , it was soo intense!
Unfollowing me during an Oilers game is like filming a porno movie inside the Vatican. Sacrilege!
The new Pope dropped the F-Bomb in a prayer? He needs a movie. Francis is a loose cannon Pope that DOESN'T play by the rules of the Vatican.
If making a movie is a miracle then the Vatican would make a Saint Spielberg.
I personally think every movie about Jesus should be free. Or that a certain amount of tickets should be purchased by the Vatican
Angels and Demons is great movie. Rome/ the Vatican are very interesting, it's crazy how everything there was created forever ago.
angels and demons is a creepy ass movie not to mention the fact that i've actually been to rome and the vatican
This movie The Godfather 3 exposed a lot of corruption in the Vatican and bankers.
Done with this movie and I get the feeling that I wanna go to the Vatican someday haha.
The Vatican Tapes is about to be a good movie ..

It's either a scene from a comedy or a scene from an apocalypse movie http://fb.me/6zfuOaajj 
Two peace doves released from Pope Francis' window at the Vatican were immediately attacked by other #birds. It's like out of a scary movie.
Oh my god. Frozen was the best movie. Ever. It was a more spiritual experience than visiting the Vatican.
They need to do a movie about robbing the Vatican of all its Gold. And 1 bar sent to every abuse victim. Prob not enough gold bars. #atheist
@VanessaHudgens new movie Gimme Shelter was endorsed by the Vatican. The VATICAN. That's amazing!
A bad Will Ferrell movie: Thanks to a mix-up with the Vatican's smoke signals, he accidentally becomes... "Dope Pope"
Hey @fatherjonathan, did you see the Vatican has endorsed #thebluesbrothers movie? http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65G0TL20100617?irpc=932 … Thought this would be of interest.
I'm going to write a fish-out-of-water buddy movie about the only two straight guys living in The Vatican.
@Film_London IT IS TIME FOR A NEW TEN COMMANDMENT MOVIE OF THE SUPERIOR KING OF THE VATICAN
I was looking for a romantic movie and I ended up watching "The Vatican Exorcisms". Okay,you can tell I love getting scared.
Endorsed by the president of the Vatican’s Pontifical Academy for Life, the movie "Gimme Shelter" opens Jan. 24. http://archokc.org/news/2462-vatican-official-endorses-film-inspired-by-real-pregnancy-shelters …
Idk why but I'm watching this documentary about the Vatican and I wanna live there it's so cute and disney movie like and european

Of course the Vatican hit squad in this movie looks like a regular Colombian drug lord's one. I wonder if that's changed w/Pope Francis now?
Did anybody else think the Emerald City in James Franco's Wizard of Oz movie looked like the Vatican? #Conspiracy #illuminati
I was watching midnight mass at the Vatican and I switched to a movie for 1 minute and a man gets shot in the head. I switched back to mass.
The Vatican should start getting the rights to a movie following the Star Wars model releasing the prequels last: Episode IV A New Pope

Interesting times having at the Vatican. This plays out like a movie. Drama, greed, violence, power, mafia...
The Vatican Tapes is a MUST watch movie when it comes out in theaters.
The Golden Compass is suppose to be a movie for kids... but the concept is so deep that the Vatican shut down the sequel...
judging by this cover there was a movie where JCVD fights the Vatican
They shd make a movie where they kidnap the pope!! Or attack the Vatican!

There’s a hidden walkway from here to the Vatican. Pretty sure I saw it in a movie.
the entire scene in the vatican is my favorite scene in any movie ever
I'd like to see the next Die Hard action movie take place in the Vatican. Their guards still use spears, so it should be a gun-fu movie too.

@dcollett86 The Vatican kinda creeps me out. But it's an alright movie, I guess.
Every Movie has to be prove by the Vatican, So why every movie even cartoons is pushing SEX then telling you to wear condoms? Think
Probably safe to assume the movie you’re watching has not been endorsed by the Vatican.
fun fact: In the Book, Frollo is a Priest, but he was changed to a Judge in the movie to not invoke the wrath of the Vatican
That movie eyes wide shut was how the Vatican be getting down. Except nasty Pope be keeping little boys under his robe with his ugly ass
The Vatican vaults is not really as impressive looking as the one depicted in the movie, Angels & Demons.
@fxnopinion YES! The same reason Hollywood is afraid to confront them in an action movie. It's safer to blow up the Vatican than a mosque.
@TheFev Don't worry, the movie is going to unfold in front of our eyes when the Vatican Bank will be closed and popes will be arrested.
Today I toured the Vatican Museum, visited St. Peter's, the Pantheon, and saw a movie being made in the streets of Rome. What about you?

I think the guys from the movie Euro trip have been messing around in the vatican again. Theres a new pope in there!
The only shit I give about the Pope is that all this news has reminded me to rewatch an "educational" movie - 'Scandal in the Vatican'
I heard the Vatican has been roped in on the new Star Wars movie: it's gonna be called Star Wars: A New Pope.
I think the guys from the movie Eurotrip have been messing around in the vatican again. Theres a new pope in there!

When I think of the #Vatican and white smoke the first thing that comes to mind is the movie EuroTrip
I can thank the movie euro trip for teaching me what the white smoke coming out of the Vatican means
Whenever I think of the Vatican, I think about that movie Eurotrip.
If Burt Wonderstone can pull it off and walks out onto the Vatican balcony, I might re-consider and go see the movie
It's like the Vatican is trying to overshadow the news that I backed the Veronica Mars movie.

@SladeHV did bill murray ever make a movie set in the vatican? QED.
I hope the new pope is a befuddled, silent movie-era physical comedian who stumbled into the Vatican somehow.
the last movie I saw with scenes set in the Vatican was Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol...I don't trust Tom Cruise #justsaying
Another marching band now. This one with cool Eye-talian movie uniforms. Now sailors (didn't know the Vatican had a navy). Now Army guys.
Whenever I think of the white smoke coming from the Vatican I think of that particular scene from the movie Eurotrip

Watching The Vatican on CNN makes me think of the movie 'EuroTrip', when they caught the hat on fire and the smoke came out white.

@ryanqnorth The Air Bud movie the Vatican doesn't want you to see!
If the Vatican can have jamming devices to block cell signals during #conclave, why can't we bring them into movie theaters?
The doors are now closed at the Vatican. The Cardinals are either voting or watching their favorite movie "Sistine Candles".

The things happening in the Vatican now reminds me of the movie Angels and Demons.. Conclave and stuff..
When the Vatican has conclave I like to imagine it's close to how it was portrayed in the movie Angels and Demons w/ Tom Hanks #crazyasfuck
I blame this on watching a doco-movie on ancient aliens followed by a doco on the Vatican. A Gray Nun. pic.twitter.com/fepWhUvtgF

Hanging out with the other Cardinals in the Vatican's movie theatre. Exorcist movie marathon! That lil girl scares the crap out of me.
I was watching a movie that took place in the Vatican and I got sad
When is Roadside Attractions going to do a Margin Call style movie around the Vatican Bank? Maybe add some Bourne style action to it?
Alfredo's Fire, a movie exposing the Vatican's homophobia, needs your help. Donate to its Kickstarter campaign http://tinyurl.com/aonnt7j

The poison of money has spread everywhere: large publishing houses, movie industry, music business industry, last but not least the Vatican.
Inside the #Vatican: organizers admit "Shoes of the Fisherman" and "The Godfather Part III" were terrible choices for movie night.
So "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys" is on the ShoTime movie channel right now... Do you think the Vatican gets ShoTime?
Dude, it actually starts off with a title card that says "The Vatican did not endorse this movie or assist in the completion of the film."
This is such a bizarre story... kind of a made-for-TV movie plot. Could the Vatican story get any crazier?? Talk... http://fb.me/CnLz3iU2 
A fake bishop was caught trying to enter the cardinal's meeting in the Vatican today. The next movie will be called, "Vatican Crashers".

@mmmaiko I went & Googled it & of course they say exactly what you said. There was a movie called "Pink Smoke Over The Vatican." sorry!

Okay. Heading to the Vatican March 12th. I've got a movie to finish in the meantime. Church is gonna have to run itself for a bit.
Easter is less than a month away and the Vatican needs to find a new pope sounds like the pitch for Adam Sandler's next movie.

Is the Pope Emeritus going to at least post movie reviews on the Vatican website from time to time?
If the Vatican is anything like an 80s action movie, the Pope should be careful not to brag about "being only two days from retirement."
BEN-HUR was the only Hollywood movie to make the Vatican’s official list of approved religious films in 1959. http://go.usa.gov/2xJ4

RT @SamWalkerOBX: I'll say it again, I plan on taking The Vatican's advice re: Stooges movie...and I'm Episcopalian
Nice to know the Vatican can also tell that the 3 Stooges movie is gonna be sin-against-mankind awful.
3 Stooges ad claiming it's the movie the Vatican doesn't want you to see does more for the PR of the Pope than it does the movie.
Forget the Vatican - *I* don't want people to see this Three Stooges movie.
I'm not Catholic, but I think the Vatican is on to something about not seeing this 3 Stooges movie.
"The movie the Vatican doesn't want you to see". Surely because they worry about me not wasting my time

The Devil Inside is advertised as the movie the Vatican doesn't want you to see, as opposed to the Top Ten they release every Christmas.

@rosemcgowan I love that movie!!! Especially when evil grandma gets mailed to the vatican city.
If the Vatican Archives are as they are in the movie, then that's a SERIOUS breach of the vow of poverty.
"Who resides in the Vatican?" girl answers " The Vaticans" Rofl pre-movie commercials are too funny haha

I don't get why the Vatican didn't like this movie. It's so pro-church and anti-science. The first one was better. Music in this one is shit

@Nine_Movie Definitely Penélope for "A Call from the Vatican" and Marion for "My Husband Makes Movies."
Dude! The Vatican was mentioned in this movie! Color me OBSESSED.
Fantastic movie on Netflix: The Courage to Love. 1st African American canonized by the Vatican. What #moviegem do u recommend? #Catholic
i think a movie against the "secrets" of the vatican is better than a movie against Jesus...
@CaffeinatedLiby Seriously, though, when Angels & Demons came out, the Vatican issued a statement declaring the movie to be "harmless"
Went to see Angels & Demons, very much enjoyed all the locations, churches, statues, Rome, the Vatican. Very pretty. Liked the movie too!
Escape from reality worked this week. Angels & Demons was a great movie. Interesting plot with the Vatican and Catholic Church. Well done
Co-worker on Angels and Demons: "I would have liked this movie except the vatican didn't kill the power grid in a binary search. That's BS."
@MIRder an exciting movie. If you made it through Da Vinci Code without cringing too much, it's worth seeing. The Vatican City is beautiful.
Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu: "You're sayeeng the Vatican's keeleeng people? That's insane!" This movie is a camp classic!
@voxine awwwww. I DO! And melissa was reading Devil Wears Prada at the Vatican Wall. How was the movie?
@paulwallbaby if you haven't seen angels and demons you should..its a hella good movie and it makes u wonder if the vatican hide things 4rea
saw a movie about the Vatican - was disappointed that the guy who parachuted out of the exploding helicopter wasn't elected pope.
@Nine_Movie I'm excited to hear Penelope sing "A Call from the Vatican" just because i LOVE that song but i liked it cause of Jane Krakowski
Angels & demons was an awesome movie.... What i would give to see the vatican archives
Angels And demons.....And, why was the Vatican mad about this movie
@rupertg The fun bit about the movie was reading the careful politics played so that the Vatican would give access to all those churches
Finished reading Angels & Demons then checked out the movie. Book was better. Two weeks until I see the Vatican for real.
Didn't really enjoy the movie tht much. But loved the Vatican architecture. Must visit the Vatican city.
Loved the movie "Angels and Demons" Tom Hanks is awesome and the scenery of ROME and the Vatican is great!
On a lighter note the Vatican city looked absolutely outstanding throughout the movie and I now wanna see that shit in the flesh!

@brandongriswold Wow. The Vatican is stepping it up. Must have been that Angels & Demons movie!

Angels & Demons book good, movie great! Must see. Made me want to go back & visit the museums, churches and the Vatican.
So, seeing Rome and the Vatican were the best part of the movie. And now I want to go there!
Great movie! I wonder what part of the vatican was CG and what part was real. #angelsndemons

Daily negativity: Why are people surprised that Angels & Demons sucked? It's a sequel to a bad movie. And why should the Vatican care?
just got back from seeing Angles & Demons...good movie. makes me want to visit the vatican even more now. woo catholicism!
Every large scale shot of The Vatican or the various churches in Rome took me out of the movie completely. Guess they rushed it a little

Didn't quite enjoy the movie, but at least gave me a tour of Rome and the Vatican.
Saw angels n demons GREAT movie! Wish there had neen a bigger explosion in the vatican tho lol
Angels & Demons was decent and actually thought Da Vinci Code was better. Movie should be renamed "Tom Hanks Scavenger Hunt in the Vatican"
@ManMadeMoon Without the exposition, that movie is just Hanks running around the Vatican not doing a damn thing.
@ManMadeMoon You have to admit that was the best bomb under the Vatican movie you've ever seen!!! (So I guess that was me) :)

As much as the Vatican may hate this, but this movie looks SWEET! http://ping.fm/KnWRo
Has Tom Hanks made another movie about a mystery in the Vatican or is The DaVinci Code just REALLY late getting to Korea?
Is the vatican really going to boycott Angels and Demons? When are they going to learn its just a movie and that its fiction.
Just saw that the Vatican is pissed about Ron Howard and the new Angels and Demons movie. No surprise there.
