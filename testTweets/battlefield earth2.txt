Red Dawn (2012) is lucky Battlefield Earth was made. Because it's probably the second worst movie made on the dollar-for-dollar scale.

"Battlefield Earth should've been a Tyler Perry movie!"
My favorite science-fi movie aren't even Star Wars, it is Alien, Blade Runner and Pluto Nash and Battlefield Earth
@JoelRDodd You'd think that would have made Battlefield Earth a better movie, wouldn't you?
@hboulware That's like bragging that you think Battlefield Earth was a good movie.
everyone, EVERYONE, has someone in their family who thinks battlefield earth is a pretty good movie

@aibagawa Would you happen to know, what do Scots generally think of Hubbard's book Battlefield Earth (not the movie)?
Would Battlefield Earth be a better movie if it starred Tom Cruise rather than John Travolta? #HailXenu
What’s The Worst Movie You’ve Ever Seen in Theaters? For me , Battlefield Earth, just straight trash
Good "bad" movie night. Batman & Robin and The Room: fine. Plan 9 From Outer Space and Battlefield Earth can piss off.
@talkhoops battlefield earth was s much better movie…never thought I’d ever utter that…
"BATTLEFIELD EARTH may be a terrible movie, but based on its inventive camera angles, ****." #OtherGlobeEndorsements
@padresj Hmm, Battlefield Earth was 1/20th the first half the book. 1050 or so pages not doable in one movie
MAHALO TWEETBUSTAHS. my favorite horror movie is Battlefield Earth!

Congrats to 'Welcome Back' for being an worse movie than 'Battlefield Earth' and 'Joker.'
@EricStallsworth @imgur I enjoyed Battlefield Earth. The movie was dreadful. Rama as a movie would be stunning...if they get it right.
@EllieMGarratt @imgur true, Rama is a good choice. One I liked a bunch was Battlefield Earth. The movie was forgettable but not the book.
I sure hope the movie is a hit. I took a bath in all those Battlefield Earth toys. #ForceFriday
@zachrymer if the Nationals were a movie, they would be the Battlefield Earth of movies. #Flop

@amisij hehehe. Read Battlefield Earth. A tad racist but if you can take it, is not too bad. It was made into a movie. Yuck.
@william_pitts I think he was referring to Battlefield: Earth being made into a lousy movie.
for reference: Battlefield Earth, The Master of Disguise, Jack & Jill, Movie 43, Catwoman, The Last Airbender all have better RT statistics
@BrewingScribe @CalliMonk Also, Battlefield Earth is a better movie than Eventbrite is a site.
Battlefield Earth is probably the worst movie ever created
Battlefield Earth. It'd be the only movie he can't make any freakin' worse. #sorrynotsorry #AddBlartImproveAMovie
Holy crap. The director of that Christian Slater movie Stranded that was really bad was the director of Battlefield Earth.

@scottEweinberg For the record, I believe the movie in this specific case was Battlefield Earth
watched #goingclear and now I want back the money I spent on that Battlefield Earth movie ticket Wait...I wanted that back in 2000
New stoner movie night: Play audio from Going Clear with video from Battlefield Earth and be amazed at how they synch up. #Xenu
@notkeithfoy BATTLEFIELD EARTH SHOULDVE BEEN A TYLER PERRY MOVIE
@TheSpoonyOne and actually, I think Stilt-Man was featured in a movie before: Battlefield Earth.
The response from my Battlefield Earth discussion is that nobody likes the movie but everyone has read the 1000 page book? How? I'm baffled.
There is a robbing Fort Knox in the year 3000 scene in Battlefield Earth. How do people seriously not like this movie?!?
I am watching the 2nd worst movie I have ever seen! Battlefield Earth being the first! #movies #whyhollywood #wastedtime

John Travolta is defending Scientology. He's also still defending his movie "Battlefield Earth"…so take that for what you will.
Blair Witch Project will go down as the worst movie ever shot in my book, even worse than Battlefield Earth.
@PLeahy97 @RefCoryPrice battlefield earth what a piece of steaming Shit. That movie is a cinematic abortion

Had to watch Battlefield Earth for the "It's The Worst Movie Club". Travolta, you may have ruined Grease for me. #Leverage
@JulesRPG @JohnnyFeisty I would rather watch hours of Barney (shudder) than Battlefield Earth (the only movie I've ever walked out on). O.o
@FO_ScottKacsmar Only movie I’ve fallen asleep during was Battlefield Earth. Though that owed more to terribleness and lack of sleep.

@_SBVB Worst movie ever made?....ahem Battlefield Earth
"Battlefield Earth, a film based on a book by L. Ron Hubbard" lawl that movie looks so awful I can't even try to watch it
@SweatpantsCafe Battlefield Earth! I loved that book way back when. The movie ruined it for me when it came out.
also, don't watch battlefield earth, its a terrible movie
@Brent_Kong we'll go get audited and say Battlefield Earth is our favorite movie
Ok, forget Scientology for a moment. I actually thought the book, 'Battlefield Earth', was a good read. Movie, no. Book, yes.

@drockalexander have you seen Battlefield Earth? It is a hilariously terrible movie, but it's based on Scientology beliefs.
Scientology movie marathon: First "Going Clear" then "The Master" and finish it with "Battlefield Earth"
@sunzdevil WTF was that movie Travolta did about the science fiction book L. Ron wrote? Like Battlefield Earth? never saw but he looked cray
Battlefield Earth is that movie where the more you know about the technique and finesse of film-making, the more painful it is to watch
WITH ENDLESS OPTIONS FOR RENEWAL is my favorite scene from Battlefield Earth because holy shit, that's just that movie in one shot, isn't it

Even more baffling is why I agreed to see Battlefield Earth in theaters. That movie may actually be as bad as DragonBall Evolution.

Just imagine trying to pitch a science fiction movie after Battlefield Earth premiered.
Based on trailer, the new Divergent movie looks historically bad. We're approaching Batman & Robin, Battlefield Earth territory I think.

The worst movie is probably Battlefield Earth. The most disappointing probably Miranda July’s The Future. That movie was traumatic.

@t_deg Battlefield Earth is definitely a worse movie but if Riddick tried to incorporate the teachings of L Ron Hubbard it'd be a tossup
So, tonight's bad movie decision is "Vampire Dog" on @SHO_Network BUT it's still 1000 times better than "Battlefield Earth" from last week
Battlefield Earth is not that bad of a movie if you just turn it on and leave it running in the background while you do other stuff.

I guess I have been sitting here watching Battlefield Earth. Worse than #GhostShark because this movie had a big budget.
@chasmurf Maybe Battlefield Earth is his favorite movie?
@deadheadalden if you get the chance, Battlefield Earth, The Happening & Red Dawn are brilliant. you DL an mp3 & play it with the movie.
Watching Battlefield Earth. I just noticed that you're watching the movie lopsided the whole time. This would scarevne if I were drunk

Watched Battlefield Earth. In it's entirety. Why do the Psychlo's speak English when it's just them talking? Also, why was this movie made?
Until today, "Battlefield Earth"'s atrocities were merely hearsay. Confirmed. "Yeast Lords" (Gentlemen Broncos) was a better sci-fi movie.

Hmm. Another Scientology-theme movie bites the big one! Will Smith's "After Earth" bombs at box office. But not as bad as Battlefield Earth!
After Earth is a Scientology movie? http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-06-03/from-battlefield-earth-to-after-earth-why-scientology-themed-films-flop#r=hpt-fs …
Makes the interesting case that 'After Earth' is the latest Scientology movie flop: http://buswk.co/11ftKGi  via @BW
"Is After Earth the worst movie ever made? Maybe not; there's always Battlefield Earth to remind us how low the bar can go" Joe Morgenstern.
Wasn't it a scientology movie #travolta @JonahNRO Battlefield Earth is on. I rate it one of the most fascinatingly awful movies of all time.
The movie battlefield earth> LeBron James
RT @Storagezilla: . @the_super_dave worse movie than Battlefield Earth?<- Apparently not, according to reviews, but getting there...
. @the_super_dave @drjmetz Is it a worse movie than Battlefield Earth? I don't think it will be if I go see it.
So, does anyone actually like Will Smith’s latest movie? One review says it was the second worst movie ever, behind only Battlefield Earth.
Watching battlefield earth on cinimax good movie
Will Smith and John Travolta are doubling down on their sci-fi movie careers by agreeing to star in and produce After Battlefield Earth.
Ok i lied The One w/ Jet Li is the worst movie i have ever saw besides Battlefield Earth.
Battlefield Earth was the worst movie I ever seen. I was mad after I seen that movie...
Is "After Earth" a Scientology propaganda movie a la "Battlefield Earth"? And is it as much of a turkey? http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/a-scientologist-reviews-earth-guest-561310 …
So, is Will Smith's After Earth movie his John Travolta's Battlefield Earth?
#confession I love the movie Battlefield Earth
Which movie is better - Battlefield Earth or After Earth? Huffpo answer...they both suck.
I just did a beer-sipping spit-take, home alone, to myself, when I saw a picture of Forrest Whitaker from the movie 'Battlefield Earth.'
@nwahs086 @AndreaKcc Battlefield Earth is the best bad movie ever. It's so bad that it's an art in itself
I guess it's true. W. Smith caught the Scientology bug from Travolta and produced the second worse movie since Battlefield Earth. #afterearth
@GodivAndCream @SMichaelRay @EW I read online that it was another undercover #Scientology movie ala Battlefield Earth
@neontaster After earth should be renamed Battlefield Earth 2. The whole movie is scientology propoganda.
Which movie is worse? Battlefield Earth or My Giant.... I can't believe I saw both in theaters!
@kiva_jane BATTLEFIELD EARTH is a helluva movie.
If you think the Battlefield Earth is the worst sci-fi movie ever, you've barely scratched the surface... they get a LOT worse.
@noobde I've been told AE might overtake Battlefield Earth as worst Hollywood Sci-Fi movie of all time. I'm seeing it just for that reason.
Marmol's so bad, if he were a movie, he'd be "Battlefield Earth".
http://everythingnabi.blogspot.com/2012/10/how-do-i-install-netflix-on-nabi-2.html … "How do I install NetFlix on the Nabi"? You don't!!! What if the kids see "Hillary the Movie" or "Battlefield Earth"?
@JonahNRO battlefield Earth is the greatest bad movie of all time. It is the Schindler's List of awful movies
@JonahNRO Believe it or not, I actually liked the Battlefield Earth book. Movie? Soooooo bad.
Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000: http://youtu.be/fFAMfvXOJaU  via @gonzolecture good book,not gr8 movie,least Teryl got his gold :))
(Movie trailer voice) "THIS SUMMER: M night shyamalan joins forces with JADEN SMITH to give WILL SMITH his own "Battlefield Earth"moment!"
Battlefield Earth is the weirdest movie.
Battlefield Earth is a really good movie ppl!!!
Battlefield Earth is a great movie guys
@EdwardStGrey23 Whoever was reviewing that new Will/Jaden Smith movie compared it to Battlefield Earth. @MelserWBAL was on broadcast. Lol
@PamelaDayM ex-Scientologist reviewer says thx to "After Earth," "Battlefield Earth" is now the 2nd worst movie, ever.
@ScifiCommons me, too. I worry this movie will be awful - similar to Travolta's Battlefield Earth. Self indulgent crap.
Also, did not know that the movie Battlefield Earth was meant to be an actual introduction to Scientology for the people who saw it.
I couldnt sleep and, w/lack of sleep, poor decisions followed. I actually watched the movie Battlefield Earth in it entirety. #SelfPunishing
Hmm. Reviews for the latest M. Night Shamalama-ding-dong movie "After Earth" are saying it's as bad as "Battlefield Earth". BIG shock there.
After Earth might be the funniest & stupidest movie since Battlefield Earth. m night shyamalan might have become Hollywood's worst director
Looks like After Earth is becoming the next Battlefield Earth. I know what movie to avoid this summer. Goodbye too Will Smith BO power.
“Is #AfterEarth the worst movie ever made? Maybe not; there’s always ‘Battlefield Earth…’” —Joe Morgenstern http://huff.to/18DJNq0 
Not since John Travolta's Battlefield Earth has a sci-fi movie been as disastrous as Will Smith’s After Earth. http://reason.com/archives/2013/05/31/after-earth-and-now-you-see-me …
@GregHNZ did you see the link I just posted about how it's a scientology movie? Shades of Battlefield Earth, but it can't be THAT good.
After Earth is getting the worst reviews I've seen since Battlefield Earth. I wouldn't recommend making Sc-Fi movie with Earth in the title
@DamonBruce Worst movie you've ever seen? Does Batman Forever and/or Battlefield Earth make the list? #2TheTweets
Will Smith’s BATTLEFIELD EARTH Said to be Worst Movie Ever Made… Oh, Wait… http://dlvr.it/3S5Kxq 
@talpostal Wow...certainly puts the movie in a different light, doesn't it? Well at least this propaganda's better than Battlefield Earth...
@petersuderman "After Earth", the worst movie ever made? Not while a negative of "Battlefield Earth" exists.
Battlefield Earth was the worst movie I've ever seen. Seems like Scientology + film is a bad combo... #AfterEarth http://www.showbiz411.com/2013/05/31/will-smith-movie-after-earth-being-called-out-by-critics-for-scientology-references …
@PaulCharchian battlefield earth was pretty bad. Father in law took me to that movie, our relationship has only gotten worse
@amuredda exactly! I wish it Scientology indoctrination movie! That'd be something fun to be excited for and love. Battlefield Earth > A.E.
Is "After Earth” the next "Battlefield Earth"? http://ow.ly/lAMHK 
#AfterEarth Guaranteed to be the "Ishtar" of Sci-Fi Movies. Not since "Battlefield Earth" was there a Sci-Fi Movie meant 2B straight-2-DVD
Only 14% positive reviews for Will Smith's Scientology movie #AfterEarth. They should have called it After Battlefield Earth.
@scottdagostino you mean they actually made another post-apocalyptic movie starring a Scientologist after Battlefield Earth?

After Earth being a Scientology movie would be interesting. If Battlefield Earth didn't exist.
WSJ review of "After Earth"... Basically it's "Battlefield Earth 2". Read it is you like biting movie reviews. http://on.wsj.com/11eT5UO

@TomMilkowitz I Weep for "Battlefield Earth" if Only because the Book was So Great, and the Movie Fell Flat. Very Sad.
I know a flop movie when I see one. After Earth I am talking to you. This is Battlefield Earth all over again word to John Travolta.
I'm just saying, if Red Barchetta was a movie, it would be up there with Battlefield Earth. As a song though, AWESOME.
Films which are genuinely better than OZ: The Room, Darling Companion, Movie 43, inAPPropriate Comedy, Dream House, Battlefield: Earth

"Battlefield Earth is a science fiction movie masterpiece," said no one ever.
The writer of Battlefield Earth; "Battlefield Earth is about the extinction of the human race, and after seeing this movie I'm all for it"
In quest for worst Netflix Instant movie, they have no Battlefield Earth but they do have a movie staring ICP.
After Pootie Tang & Battlefield Earth went 1 - 2, I took Romy and Michelle's High School reunion at 3 in @FFRittle's Worst Movie Ever Draft
Battlefield Earth could've been such a great movie. SHAME!!!
"Battlefield Earth" just reshaped my definition of bad. The worst story I've ever heard, the worst movie I've ever seen.
Even John Travolta's movie abomination "Battlefield Earth" had fans i guess. #Community
@JasonZingale And that's probably why you'd give BATTLEFIELD EARTH zero stars. Where was Pepper's goatee in that movie???
All in all, still better than "Battlefield Earth." RT via @MuseumofRobots Robot writes movie script 'Do You Love Me'. http://goo.gl/prgIc 
@bwinfrey @barbiebobomb Battlefield Earth is still my go-to date movie. Made us leave the theatre early.
No work tomorrow? I'll finish up Aliens Anthology with Alien Resurrection. Worst alien movie of all time. Even worse than Battlefield Earth.

Combined Movie Titles: "Battlefield Earth Girls Are Easy" - John Travolta, Jeff Goldblum, Madonna

One of Mitt Romney's favorite books is "Battlefield Earth" by L. Ron Hubbard. I always thought the movie was better.
But maybe I am just a hardened movie watcher. I have seen Battlefield Earth like 4 times. #humancentipede
It turns out the movie of Battlefield Earth is a MASSIVE improvement over the book, and that the unfilmed second half is even worse.

I don't care if John Travolta sexually assaulted those people or not. Battlefield Earth was a piece of shit movie and I want my money back!
I do not know why everyone is always so down on Battlefield Earth... it is a decent SciFi movie.

What movie should never have been made? — Battlefield Earth.Worst movie I ever saw in a theater. I should have ask… http://4ms.me/f1NyhQ
Haven't things like Left Behind and Battlefield Earth taught these idiots anything? Insane beliefs do not a good movie make.
YIKES! @justinbieber's movie "Never Say Never" has a 1.1/10 rating on IMDB! That's worse than The Room and Battlefield Earth! That's BAD!
Finally, whiny billionaires and Libertarians get their action movie. Welcome to the Battlefield Earth of this decade: http://bit.ly/i5csjf
So they're making a movie out of Atlas Shrugged. I predict it will do for Libertarianism what Battlefield Earth did for Scientology.
Biutiful was the worst movie I have seen in ages. The closest since Battlefield Earth I have come to walking out of a theatre.
RT @OTOOLEFAN: Be funny if the "Atlas Shrugged" movie coming out doesn't turn a profit. \\ I expect it to be much like "Battlefield Earth."
About 2 watch Battlefield Earth w/ my son(a sci-fi movie from 2000 w/ John Travolta).
Atlas Shrugged movie? Right. I'll watch that right after I see Battlefield Earth.
The young ticket taker at the cinema's favorite movie was listed as Battlefield Earth. Never met that young of a scientologist before.
even the jokes about the movie are scary RT @hodgman Fake screenwriting news: Paul Hagis officially OFF the planned Battlefield Earth reboot
RT @socratic Atlas Shrugged: The Movie = Battlefield Earth + Showgirls/don't forget the the "rape to make you understand"
Atlas Shrugged: The Movie = Battlefield Earth + Showgirls
Swedish libertarians are reminding us of what a fantastic president Dubya really was. Also, Battlefield Earth is a true gem of a movie.
@melancholygirl insists on watching Battlefield Earth. Possible revenge for making her watch that weird Belgian horror movie, Calvaire?
The worst movie I think I've ever seen, Battlefield Earth, is getting ready to come on.
RT @DAvallone: I think the new Atlas Shrugged movie will make a nice future double feature with Battlefield: Earth. #whatafoolbelieves
Who is watching battlefield earth? I am. Prolly the worst movie ever made.
@frankarincon don't listen to Amy the Girl. Battlefield Earth the book, is pretty damn good. Way different from the movie.
Wow. Battlefield Earth really is a flaming pile of turd of a movie. It really, truly is unwatchable.
Watching "Battlefield Earth: a Saga of the Year 3000" which is the funniest movie of all time. Unintentionally.
I have never walked out of a movie, but came close at Battlefield Earth.
Battlefield Earth is a great movie.
I wonder if the Scientologists who made Battlefield Earth into a movie intended on making L Ron Hubard look like an idiot.
The zypper package manager is a big, steaming bowl of failure. If it was a movie it'd be Battlefield Earth. Wait, I like Battlefield Earth.
tried to watch the movie ''battlefield earth''..oh my god....oh my god!!!!
Bad movie night was a failure yesterday. Apparently an hour of "Battlefield Earth" is harder to watch than "Wicker Man" and "Thankskilling".
I've never done drugs. But I reckon if you want some good ones, you should see the guy that made the movie Battlefield Earth. #fb
I'm trying to figure out how True Grit jabbed so many Oscar nods. Worst movie since Battlefield Earth.
'Season of the Witch' is a 'feel good movie' in that it feels good to finally have something we can compare 'Battlefield Earth' to...
Always remember kiddos - dropping a reference to Battlefield Earth is the nuclear option of all "Bad movie" arguments.
All new movie review Battlefield Earth, have you seen a movie any worse?
just watched BATTLEFIELD:EARTH with barry pepper....that movie was wrong on sooo many levels. loved the concept though
Despite its glaring plot holes, cheesy acting, and over Scientology leanings, Battlefield Earth is a really good movie.
The worst movie of all time... according to some people :-) (Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000 via @gomiso) http://miso.io/bFjfwB
RT @msmac Can exclusively reveal Piranha was worst. movie. evah. And I've seen Battlefield Earth!
Never took the time to watch the movie Battlefield Earth. And wow...this is a terrible, terrible thing. I'm a worse human being now.
You know what's a really bad movie? Battlefield Earth... but I can't stop watching
Battlefield earth, amazingly horrible movie! Lol i love it
Battlefield Earth is the weirdest movie ever. Thanks L. Ron Hubbard? Wonder why Travolta's in it ha
Titanic 2.... Really?!... This will "good down" as the worst idea for a film in movie history!!! And Battlefield Earth was pretty bad.

Someone come save me from the "Battlefield Earth" this movie is loaded with 9 novels of si fi nonsense. #fb

Wow... I never thought I would see a movie that was worse in so many, many ways than "Battlefield Earth" http://imdb.to/gKUzzT
@rantingpudding Well, then I can't really fault you for watching it. I'd watch Battlefield: Earth if it was the last movie in existence.
@Tyler_Reks ... You look like Travolta in Battlefield Earth; and that movie suckedddd.
i try to soldier through even the worst movie, just to see how it ends. i only made it 30 minutes into 'Battlefield Earth'. it was that bad.
Ugh. Watching the stupid movie Battlefield Earth. Why? Brain cramp. Only valid reason to waste sleep time like this.
so, two of my bad movie goals down: I've seen plan 9, and battlefield earth. if only I could get deafula in my paws. xD
had a very strange dream during an interlude of sleep during the movie "Battlefield Earth" - themes rarely dreamt, situations unencountered
Just watched the movie skyline. Absolute crap! Think perfect storm meets battlefield earth.
watching Battlefield Earth. The worst movie ever made.
Battlefield Earth, the worst movie ever made is on television. This movie convinces me Scientology is up to something shady.
Battlefield Earth: how is it possible to make a movie this bad by accident? Did they ask the actors for really bad performances?
Battlefield Earth...omg, what a mess of a movie THIS is. I guess this must be the "Jesus flick" for the Scientology crowd, huh?
Right now we're watching the movie Battlefield Earth it only has one star is it possible to get half of the star?
ActionTV playing the worst movie ever made - Battlefield Earth. #SMH

Maybe I should have kept watching Battlefield Earth...I knew what to expect from that movie ( ooohhh so campy)
Battlefield Earth is as appallingly bad movie. But not as lousy as Twilight
Who has seen battlefield earth? Is John Travolta really a rastafarian alien in the movie?

Repo man was the worst movie i saw since battlefield earth, sadly both of em starred by very lovely forest whiteker.
I think I may have found a movie that gives Battlefield Earth a run for its money as worst movie I've ever seen, All About Steve.
Worst movie ever! even worse then Transformers 2 and Battlefield Earth. http://digs.by/ayrtJA
#ireallythink whoever turned the book Battlefield Earth into a movie needs to be stabbed in the face.
Oprah's audience was thrilled John Travolta was flying them to Australia--until they realized the in-flight movie was "Battlefield Earth"
1050 pages, 2 weeks, 1 hella good sci-fi book - Battlefield Earth. The movie, aweful.
the only downside? http://yhoo.it/cOwIr4 the in flight movie is Battlefield Earth
Sure, Oprah's sending audience to Australia, but with Travolta as pilot, probably stuck with "Battlefield Earth" as the in-flight movie.
Battlefield Earth is also the most enjoyable worst movie experience I've ever had. Every scene will either provoke howls of laughter or WTF.
It's a shame they didn't make another Battlefield Earth movie. Curious as to how the other alien races would have looked on screen.
Yep, it's craplousy. RT @01mikenav01 "Watched Battlefield Earth Rifftrax last night. Rifftrax was hilarious, actually movie was terrible."
Join me on Saturday when I'll be burning copies of Battlefield: Earth (novel and movie) in protest of Scientology.
I liked Battlefield Earth the movie and I'm liking the book. Will the same hold true for The Postman?
15 minutes of G.I. Joe and it's already the worst movie I've ever seen. Note: I've seen Battlefield Earth and 20 minutes of Gigli.

Avatar and Battlefield Earth are the same movie.
My favorite book as a teen, completely borked as a movie RT @PalmettoRunner: @AirForceTed Hollywood brought us Battlefield Earth.'Nuff said.
Oh good grief, they're making a Battleship movie - as in "you sunk my...". It's got a $200 million budget. Hello, Battlefield Earth 2.
This movie has more dutch angles than battlefield earth. I didn't think that was even possible!
I just realized something. Alex Mercer's voice actor played the hero in the Battlefield Earth movie. For shame, Mr. Mercer. For shame...
Battlefield Earth really is a bad movie. Strangely I feel more accepting of Scientology though. Subliminal thetans.
John Trevolta's worse movie besides Battlefield Earth lmao RT @M_Ali3: Yess! One of my favorite movies is on - 'Grease'

The Book of Eli. What a crap movie. The setting from The Road meets a bad script. It's Battlefield Earth for the christian youth. #fb
I rather enjoyed the movie of Battlefield Earth so I'm going to try reading the book. E-book's a lot less intimidating than the paperback
For The Pleasure of Your Company is easily the worst movie I've ever seen. And I've seen Battlefield Earth.
Yesterday was an epic fail of epic proportions. If it was equated to a movie in terms of success it would have been Battlefield Earth.
I nominate it for worst movie ever! RT @bencefraisser Battlefield Earth, was recently dubbed worst movie of the decade.
