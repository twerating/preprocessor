At least that's what I've been telling myself all these years because of how poorly concieved Catwoman's character in that movie was.

Watching The Cat & The Canary on @Svengoolie. Love that he decorates the set to match the movie w/action figures of Catwoman & Black Canary.

Watching Gotham. Didn't anyone tell Jada that the Catwoman movie was terrible? She seems to be doing her best to channel it .__.
Catwoman had such potential to be a great movie. But the plot sucked, the fighting scenes were corny & short, & Halle berry played her
i can't believe people are still using the fact that catwoman was a flop to prove that women can't lead in a comic book movie ??

Catwoman is only in the movie to set up a way for Batman to disappear at the end. She's an undeveloped character with no thematic purpose.

strangely enough, i only like catwoman in her movie incarnations (halle berry's doesn't count!) and not in any of her comic versions
The movie Catwoman isn't so bad if you sleep through it.
I just learned that Lee Meriwether aka 60's Batman movie Catwoman once played Lily Munster!!
So we got from Black cat To cat woman To Bat-god To E2 being shit Then Val being useless Than Catwoman being the Number one movie
If Catwoman is a good movie. David Cameron fucking a pig is a good political move.
@HostofFate Catwoman is a gem and better than any movie DC scripted. And I'm not seeing what's wrong with your accusation if it were true
@CocoCaliente_ --Over any other characters because they're black. Even if they were shit like movie Catwoman.
@CocoCaliente_ No, that's the WHOLE reason. Same with movie Catwoman, you just like her because she's black. You prefer black characters--

@MikeIsaac your movie opinions are simply the worst. (Catwoman was fun and the Bat was cool; Bane got tiresome; all else was meh)
I've introduced my son to the 1966 Batman movie. It's such a joy to see Catwoman Lee Meriwether slinking around my TV.

The very beginning of Catwoman isn't as bad as the rest of the movie.
3:30AM observations: the 2004 Catwoman "movie" is putrid, horrid non-entertainment.
Catwoman is my top favorite so I like to think that that Halle Berry movie never existed

"Catwoman" was a good movie to me.
Crappy production design and dull scenario set aside, this movie was not such a disaster. It could have been worse (Catwoman, remember?).

@Catwoman1775 Good morning Catwoman, yep it's a great movie, how are you?
@mrmouthalmighty I also think she would make a stunning Catwoman in the next Batman movie or whatever.
7 + 1 things that need to happen in the Batman Movie would be.. Michelle Pfeiffer reprises her role as Catwoman. @ClevverMovies #batman
@booshoe37 I just can't believe it's a superhero movie rated that low. That's like, Catwoman status!
Home sick last 2 days. Sewed Catwoman costume and binged on Veronica Mars and SLCPunk! Love that movie.

@FastCompany Catwoman 2004. Best movie evar.
Fantastic 4 is literally first superhero movie I have ever not enjoyed. And I liked CATWOMAN. I didn't even think it was possible...
Sometimes when you have low expectations you'll be pleasantly surprised. Except for the Catwoman movie. That's as bad as everyone said.
Say what you want about the Halle Berry Catwoman movie but man was that costume on point.
See here's the thing I don't think Harley, Catwoman, or Ivy could pull off their own solo movie but TOGETHER anything is possible:))
Just a reminder that the Catwoman movie with Halle Berry created the idea of otherkin.
I am watching the #Catwoman movie and wow this is a real piece of shit.
Sorry to beat a dead cat, but Catwoman might be the first film to seriously compete with Nothing But Trouble for worst movie I've ever seen.
After watching Catwoman, I am not convinced Halle Berry nor anyone involved in the movie ever actually met a cat.
Catwoman is probably the worse movie ever made
Thought I was watching a terrible romance movie but it turns out it's 2004 Catwoman lmao.

Watched "Spawn". First time since 97. it's even more of a wreck of a movie than I'd remembered. Not Halle Berry catwoman bad, but BAD
Going by Rotten Tomatoes, new Fantastic Four movie scored lower than Ghost Rider, Superman IV and Catwoman. It can't be that bad, surely?

Remember the movie "Catwoman", man it was a piece of shit
Guys, should I watch the Catwoman movie in honour of Spider-Man Day?
I haven't even seen the Catwoman movie, I'm sure it's painful to watch.
I disliked FANTASTIC 4 but those who call it the worst comic book movie ever haven't seen X-MEN 3,CATWOMAN,STEEL or MAN-THING(among others).
The new fantastic four is the worst superhero movie I've ever seen since Catwoman
@HopeCBS8 remember when went to see that terrible "Catwoman" movie in the theater? I just watched it yesterday in remembrance of you
Someone on Tumblr said they would cast Rih as Catwoman in an all black cast for a batman movie smh.
They're like somebody tried to make a potato chip out of the Catwoman movie. https://twitter.com/kouban/status/630590438097952769 …
@NoNonsenseMofo @AbbyVx You know I almost went with Steel but I once posted a picture of that movie so went with Catwoman instead hehe
Catwoman is my most most favorite movie in the world pic.twitter.com/7pbHOwi08V
#FantasticFour was terrible , Don't go see that bullshit , Not enough action . The worst superhero movie . #Catwoman was better than this.

http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/08/09/putting-the-response-to-the-fantastic-four-into-perspective/ … RT score of F4 is on par with Catwoman. But click to see how bad it really is RT superhero movie score wise.
@DCComics make a Catwoman, Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy movie plz
@ErinRRichards hey! i just realized dat u look like M.Pfeiffer when she was younger and when she played Catwoman in the 2nd batman movie :)
Can we talk about how Elektra and Batman & Robin are rated higher than @FantasticFour ? The movie is even tied with Catwoman. #proudofyoufox
@JCChasez maybe some day there'll b a Catman movie, we already have ones w Catwoman. I hope that u'll b in it xo. pic.twitter.com/QHZdabEq8I
FANTASTIC FOUR is the most boring superhero movie since Halle Berry's Catwoman. Review here: http://marcfennell.com/reviews  pic.twitter.com/HU20HldewM
The new Fantastic Four film is probably the worst superhero movie since Catwoman. #FantasticFour #FantasticFail
i used to watch the catwoman movie every night as a kid because i couldnt fall asleep without it lmao
The special effects in this movie are disappointing, like Catwoman bad CG
Catwoman is on. 1 of my first films I did. I did it myself. I designed my part in the movie. pic.twitter.com/hGcjfPtPR0
Nobody sets out to make a movie bad on purpose. Well, almost nobody.... Catwoman starring Halle Berry happened.
My dad just said that the first jurassic park movie was trash, and that catwoman was a good movie. What?!
I wud love to see a spiderwoman movie...they allready made a catwoman movie its spideys turn

@Rumym8 @trade4shad The Last Airbender Jack and Jill Disaster Movie Catwoman
@hex_boyfriend I once came up with a rough sketch of what would have made a good Batman/Catwoman movie in a discussion on here w/ a few ppl.
@george_garner8 No! I'm just prepping. Catwoman would totally be a good movie to watch with friends and booze.
@hex_boyfriend The Catwoman story could have been made into a separate, far better movie and completely extricated from the Bane crap.
I don't remember the last time I didn't see a comic book movie. Catwoman maybe?
@NotoriousJnX @voxdotcom No, no. Obviously you've never seen Catwoman with Halle Berry. That was the worse super hero movie ever. =)

Fantastic Four has been crowned the worst comic book movie since Batman & Robin.. Meaning Ghost Rider & Catwoman were classics in comparison

@EmilyBett DC Action TV starts now a special Batman 1966 movie with 4 special guest villains Lee Meriwether as Catwoman No.2 .
Catwoman was such a bad movie
THIS CATWOMAN MOVIE IS SO BAD
Forgot how much of a steaming turd that Catwoman movie was
why did the catwoman movie portray her as a superhero bc that got me confused for ages and i only found out not long ago shes a villian
Hahahaha. Catwoman is such an awful movie.
I forgot there was even a catwoman movie because it is literally so bad
im watching the 2004 catwoman movie and god the acting and effects are atrocious
If I had to compare how bad Fantastic Four was to another movie it would be Catwoman Even the old fantastic fours were better than this
#Catwoman is on. Haven't seen this movie in a very long time.
@MisterDev3reaux with Green Lantern, some decided "OK, DC movie fans don't want colorful costumes & jokey heroes." With Catwoman, some-
Fantastic Four definitely competing with Hulk and Catwoman for the shittiest superhero movie ever award.

@indiebeatsharry I saw this photo & it said "the name of a character from your favorite book & the last movie you saw = your username"
Its funny how the Catwoman movie was basically a revamped version of her story in Batman Returns with the camp bumped up to absurdity
@TheCoolTeacher_ Halle Berry's Catwoman will forever be the worst. Forever. Without any other movie ever really needing to apply
Real talk o wanted to live tweet a movie after watching catwoman last night sober and it was soooooo bad
Hilarious. The new Fantastic 4 movie is sitting on par with Catwoman. That is an impressive feat these days.
Best scene in the movie: Catwoman doing sexual purs and this soap is 2 different people even with endless contrary evidence.
If I could cast my own Black Batman movie... - caston-mylove: king-emare: Batman Robin Catwoman... http://tmblr.co/ZsO65m1rThGUL 
The only movie I can think of where a comic book movie takes the source material and tears it 10000000000000% to shreds is Catwoman
#FantasticFour is not the worst comic movie. That honor belongs to Catwoman, Elektra, Man-Thing, Batman & Robin...
@EntityDJI @BioDevil_Dom I mean other than that and Croc, they made CATWOMAN THE GAME. That game that had the same quality as the movie.
@gameragodzilla @Mischief_Rises @countdeathtoll @andrewgleason Catwoman had barely any action & what was there was like a bad Cinemax movie
@Terrence_Sage How disappointed are you that F4 is the movie that ranks between Catwoman and Batman and Robin? https://twitter.com/Wasgo/status/629725154843586560 …
I love the ending of Catwoman. A woman does not need a boyfriend to be happy. #everydayfeminism #feministfriday. New Catwoman movie soon?
Aquí un par de críticas: "Fantastic Four is Catwoman-level awful" y "The worst third act of any superhero movie in recent memory".
I make no apologies. I even found redeemable aspects to the Catwoman movie and Star Trek V. But Fantastic Four really really disappointed.
You can be free, and freedom is power #CatWoman #Movie
Watching #CatWoman. My favorite #movie! I can watch it everydayyyy What about u? What is your favorite movie?
There's a lot wrong with it, but it's a league above Catwoman/Jonah Hex/any Big Momma's movie you want to name.
@chaddukes damn. I understand why tho. The almighty villain in each movie has died. #F4 has the same rating as Catwoman
#FantasticFour reviews had been so horrible, 9% on @rottentomatoes, same level w/ #Catwoman movie. Worst superhero movie of all time?
Well done @20thcenturyfox you managed to make a comic book movie as bad as Catwoman. #FantasticFiasco #FantasticFour Not so fantastic
Everyone bashing #FantasticFour ...Don't expect a @Marvel movie from @20thcenturyfox #lowerexpections #Catwoman
People are comparing Fantastic Four to Catwoman...and I know I did not like that movie, even tho I was young when I saw it...

Still refuse to believe FF is the worst comic. lol movie ever when we have the likes of Batman and Robin, Catwoman and X-men Origins
Rating dari Tomatoes untuk F4 semakin menurun, dah 9% sekarang, 1% more than the worst superhero movie ever existed, Catwoman
I guess I'll go take a look in the movie and out of disguise it is clearly Catwoman.

Yo the new Fantastic Four is getting worse reviews than the Catwoman movie.
Okay so we all know Catwoman was a terrible movie, but I do appreciate how wholeheartedly Halle Berry committed to the role.
@Fantastic_Crap @FantasticFour And yet NOT the worst superhero movie ever, despite its non-release (>cough Catwoman cough<)

Would it be inappropriate to call the new fantastic 4 movie the next catwoman or Green lantern?
// I predicted the new fantastic four movie would flop, but not to this degree. It is lower than Halle Berry's catwoman on Rotten Tomatoes!
I've never seen the basketball scene from Halle Berry's Catwoman and now it's my favorite scene in any movie ever https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNlmRId2FVQ …
Catwoman is the stupidest fucking movie ever
Ever just have the urge to watch that old hale berry catwoman movie? Yeah me neither.
I need a movie where Catwoman and Blackwidow fight evil
Update: 'Fantastic Four' is now at 9%, tied with 'Catwoman' as the lowest-rated blockbuster superhero movie ever.
This FF movie is lower on RT than Green Lantern, Jonah Hex, Elektra, both Ghost Riders, Batman and Robin, and tied with Catwoman. Holy...
@paexie but you know. Marvel movie. Gotta watch em all(all 18, wasn't it....)(plus it seems I like many bad movies xD Catwoman 4example)
Fantastic 4 (the movie I'm being forced to watch) has a lower score than Ghost Rider 2, Elektra, and has the same score as Catwoman. #KillMe
@edgarlive09 so think of the worst movie you've seen or compare it to batman & robin/catwoman or something it's worse than that x6
The next advertising blurb for the new "Fantastic Four" movie: "Hey, we scored 1% higher than 'Catwoman' on Rotten Tomatoes!"
It makes me sad that a Comic movie can get worse than Catwoman!! Fantastic four I guess I will wait for the blue ray release!!! :(
A few are calling it the worst superhero movie ever, worse than Catwoman and Batman and Robin.
when your movie has a worse rating then 2004 catwoman HMMMMMMMM pic.twitter.com/kkKPiZUXs8
Remember that really bad Catwoman movie? No? Good.
@M_et_Mlilian33 @ZaraLarsson_UK I must have missed that movie because I've never seen the Joker as beautiful as Zara. She's like Catwoman!
Fantastic 4 is now at 7% on Rotten Tomatoes. For perspective, Catwoman is 9% and Elektra is 10%. I'm thinking this movie might not be good.
Come home to my family watching the Catwoman movie....I thought I didn't do anything wrong but I clearly did something to deserve this
just watched Catwoman on HBO. What do I win? I don’t think Halle Berry has sat through that entire movie before.
wow it's official......fantastic 4 is the worst comic book movie of all time.....it has a lower score than catwoman lmaoooo
Dreamt of DC movies all night. Guys. That Catwoman movie with Julia Louis-Dreyfus is going to be incredible.
@Superherologist yeah so CATWOMAN wasn't the Worst Movie ever yet if defied expectations associated with the character, franchise & property
Catwoman really is a terrible movie.

@SuperBroMovies The movie did have some good moments. I mean, it wasn't Catwoman.
#HalleBerry love to see her in these roles. Loved Catwoman fav movie
Day off, went to see @FantasticFour, It is a pathetic excuse of a 'superhero' movie, worst I've seen since Catwoman. #FantasticFour

@JoshEberley well those 2 films got great ratings from movie goers and critics alike. Catwoman received terrible reviews in both categories.
Halle Berry 's Catwoman movie intro is almost a copy of Sleepwalkers intro
oh god the 2003 catwoman movie sucks so bad.
@SebaJawnikowski @AndrewDBailey Nah, I'm with Andrew here. That bball scene in catwoman itself was the worst movie ever.
Can you name a single movie that is definitively worse than 2004's Catwoman?
remember when halle berry was a promising catwoman but they botched the entire movie
Granted, the majority of those films suck, but when was the last superhero movie with a black lead actor? Catwoman in 2004?
Okay can a movie with Catwoman, Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn please happen

A movie in which Catwoman, Wolverine, Noah, That One Mean Girls Chick, and Stephen Hawking, sing about the French Revolution has to be good.
they should make a new Catwoman movie with Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman herself
@haIfbaeked although I want a movie with Harley Quinn poison ivy and catwoman all together like can u imagine
can there be a Killerfrost movie or Catwoman or any villainess movie please and thanx?
everyone knows the only good superhero movie is catwoman. then maybe elektra. but definitely catwoman
Anne Hathaway deserves her own catwoman movie.
catwoman is the competent one in this movie, like hermonie in every “harry potter” movie.

The Joker was holding his own for half the movie. More was excess. Bane, Catwoman, and Two-Face could have easily held up their own films.

So they have Catwoman in the movie and out of disguise it is clearly Catwoman. Does a fake Russian accent and boobs really thwart Batman?

Sailor Moon reminds me soo much of the movie Catwoman. One of them definitely got ideas from the other
Everything else about Catwoman in this movie was about cats EXCEPT THAT ONE TIME SHE CALLED HERSELF A BITCH and its still bothering me
@OnePerfectShot apologies to Mr Nolan, but this is the best Batman movie. And Michelle Pfieffer is the definitive Catwoman.
Say what you like about the movie, but Michelle Pfeiffer was an awesome Catwoman in #BatmanReturns.

If you gotta pull an old script out of your desk to finish a three-movie contract, at least rewrite the damn thing. Chappie is Catwoman bad,
@kaw0rutan the catwomans? if we are counting JUST her portrayal the catwoman movie she was pretty cute, but Tim burton cat is my fav
im going 2 become sharon stones character in that rly bad catwoman movie u know where she essentially turns in2 a twilight vampire
Batman has a lot of cool toys, but if he uses anything but a laser pointer to catch Catwoman in the next movie, I'll be really disappointed.
Not only is Catwoman a terrible movie but it was also shot so poorly...
@HonestlyJon Where's my live-action Catwoman Harley Quinn Poison Ivy movie? I keep digging around but I can't seem to find it
I mean we can all agree that the Catwoman movie would have been so much better if DeVito had played Selena Kyle instead of Halle Berry

@lovelysansa Catwoman with Halle Berry was the worst superhero movie ever... But I "appreciated" it anyway because there was a female hero!
I don't mind the Catwoman movie. The story seemed off to me, and the acting a little bland, but I can see why people like it.
I liked the movie when I was younger. But growing up, I see that it kinda' shit on who Catwoman is. NOT BECAUSE HALLE'S BLACK.
Uh. People don't hate on Catwoman because of Halle Barry or the color of her skin. They hate it because it was a shitty movie.
Catwoman was the /WORST/ comic book movie ever made, I swear Batman & Robin is better.

If I ever became a famous actress, my dream roles to play are Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Audrey Hepburn in an movie about her and the Virgin Mary
@Jamey_Giddens still not as bad as the Catwoman movie
I have trouble trusting people who think 2004's "Catwoman" was a good movie.
Batman has a lot of cool toys, but if he uses anything but a laser pointer to catch Catwoman in the next movie, I'll be really disappointed.
Best superhero movie ever for me is Batman Returns with THE BEST CATWOMAN FUCK A ANNE HATHAWAY in Michelle Pfeiffer.
If they ever do another Batman66 style movie or TV show they should totally get Jennifer Lawrence to fill in for Julie Newmar's Catwoman.

let's take a moment to remember Marvel's CEO saying that a female superhero movie would never succeed, citing films like Electra & Catwoman

Why isn't there a movie about the Sirens (Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy and Catwoman) of Gotham City? I would kill to see that.

Batman has a lot of cool toys, but if he uses anything but a laser pointer to catch Catwoman in the next movie, I'll be really disappointed.
@Mixiofficial well we have the new "catwoman" for the next Batman movie
@adamtvaccaro @bmolynch As did the 2004 Catwoman movie
We should be blaming Isaac "no female hero films b/c Catwoman was a bad movie" Perlmutter for the sad lack of diversity in the MCU.

@morningstream True.. but some of that dialog from Catwoman for example? At least Supergirl had the excuse of being an 80s movie, lol..
Catwoman movie is rated 3.3/10 on IMdB but I like it ???
"Catwoman was important. This film was a disaster." Which, of course, means people just hate Catwoman, not THAT SPECIFIC MOVIE.
My son is so excited about his new Batman umbrella, Rihanna should probably play Catwoman in the next movie.
I need another Catwoman movie. It needs to be done right. Filmmakers owe that to the character and the fans.
@TIME well if you talk about catwoman then yes. But that is the exception not the rule. A black widow movie would be awesome!
@RowanKaiser CEO of Marvel said in writing "we will never make a female-led movie b/c Catwoman" but no, let's attack Widow characterization!
@spencerspoofs @DCComics You need to know about VIxen as a character and watch the Catwoman movie... and if you don't get it I can't help.
That moment you realize the Catwoman movie was actually Vixen. Way to go @DCComics! pic.twitter.com/JeMARaoHYR
@PIETR0MAXlM0FF also it was a catwoman cameo in the last batman movie it was lame lmao
Wait what's the other superheroine movie failure besides Catwoman? UltraViolet??
Hi yes can we please do a Catwoman film bc she's one of my fav characters and her one movie is a fucking disaster.
I once dumped a guy cause he said Catwoman was a "great" movie...I couldn't handle dating someone with bad taste
Anyway that Marvel exec seems tragically unaware that there WAS a Catwoman movie that was totally fantastic actually pic.twitter.com/D8aE6n3bDU
Like Catwoman's goggles sort-of looking like cat ears by coincidence, because apparently in a movie called Batman a cat costume's too silly.
I once broke up with a guy cause he said Catwoman was a good movie. Truth be told, I still don't regret that level of shallowness
I still don't understand how we got a Catwoman movie that *wasn't* Catwoman
Halle Berry's Catwoman wasn't even a bad movie. I STILL don't understand this slander.
@FreakZoneGames @PhaseChan Why not a Catwoman movie based on the events of Batman Returns? Nah. Too much sense. Gotta make it more GIRLY.
Are we really not getting a Black Widow movie because Catwoman was awful? http://thinkprogress.org/culture/2015/05/05/3654649/leaked-email-marvel-ceo-listicle-women-cant-superheroes/ …
The Catwoman movie was really like "Look! She's a badass but a GIRL! Isn't that UNUSUAL AND COOL!", doesn't work that way guys XD
@FreakZoneGames Oh lord Catwoman. Or as I like to call it: Shot Recycle: The Movie
@j_zimms Imagine a Catwoman movie that was actually good and wait I just remembered it actually did exist- it was just called Batman Returns
Oh dear Jesus this moron thinks that the godawful Catwoman movie is actually connected to Batman https://twitter.com/abrahamjoseph/status/595631068071514112 …
Remember when we made a Catwoman movie that boiled down to two women fighting over makeup?
"Women can't be in superhero movies because Catwoman" Like really? that movie was a failure because it was a Catastrophe #LogicAndPuns
Yeah guys, it was the fact Catwoman was a woman the movie flopped. Not because someone filmed scenes like this: https://youtu.be/rNlmRId2FVQ 
Catwoman was terrible because a) wrong actress b) it had the tone of a romantic comedy through half the movie: http://goo.gl/1Muk4J 
@RealGilbertACP @RealGilbert @LeeMeriwether @julienewmarreal DK Rises was best movie w/a catwoman, but Hathaway just happened to play role
@RealGilbert All of em good in dif ways. Poor Halle would have been good as catwoman in a better actual movie :(
I don't care what anyone says, I liked the Catwoman movie.
Why so long for a @Marvel female superhero movie? Because CEO cites failure of 'Elektra', 'Catwoman', and 'Supergirl' http://blogs.indiewire.com/womenandhollywood/marvel-ceo-doesnt-believe-in-female-superheroes-20150504 …

~No matter what though, a movie about the Super Villains is a refreshing idea. Prediction: it will be better than #Catwoman. #SuicideSquad.~
When are they going to make a Catwoman movie? Oh right, they did and it was SO FUCKING TERRIBLE. I just want one good representation, please
Catwoman has been played by several black women and yet every time I've seen a Batman movie or video game, cat woman Is always a white lady!
the suicide squad movie is making the catwoman movie look like the dark knight
i got : Batman fav character : Joker otp : Batman/Catwoman fav friendship : Batman/ John Blake rt for a movie/book/show

I would love to see a Catwoman tv series. Done right. No movie. Catwoman over black widow all day long. .....

Did I see the same movie as people praising 'Age of Ultron'? It was the same levels of bad as 'Catwoman' but less emotionally captivating.

@the_author_ Yep. I mean, I know a number of takes on Catwoman. The Halle Berry movie had nothing to do with any of them. It was terrible.
@the_author_ I haven't seen studios try very hard to make even a decent female led superhero movie. Catwoman? Elektra? Am I forgetting any?
#Convergence is among the worst things DC has ever done... And I'm factoring in the Catwoman movie.

Interstellar 9/10 Wasn't as confusing as people said and it was an all around good movie. McConaughey was great and so was Catwoman.
Catwoman was not a good movie, but Halle Barry was looking like flame all throughout so that's a positive.
Batman has a lot of cool toys, but if he uses anything but a laser pointer to catch Catwoman in the next movie, I'll be really disappointed.
They should've given Anne Hathaway her own Catwoman movie

You know sometimes you have an opinion that is apparently not shared by anyone else? Well here's one from me: Catwoman is a very bad movie.

@ShandaFay They so need to make a Batgirl movie. They have made many Batman ones but never a Batgirl. They even made a bad catwoman movie.
Spider-man doesn't eat insects Not sure why Catwoman has to start eating cat-food Other than being a horrible movie #151pm

I want to see a Catwoman movie that is more like the Pink Panther or a Heist movie. She was, after all, a 'cat burglar'.
@cruiser1977 Like when I went to see Catwoman with 2 flasks in my pockets and left thinking the movie was pretty good. Yeah, not valid.
Batman has a lot of cool toys, but if he uses anything but a laser pointer to catch Catwoman in the next movie, I'll be really disappointed.
I really ship Catwoman & Batman <33 The Dark Knight Rises is always the perfect movie to watch at night! Omg, I love it!

I hope Rih plays Catwoman in a movie sometime. Not the Halle Berry version but in a Batman flick where she's the love interest and villain.

Catwoman might actually be a worse movie than Snakes on a Plane #andthatssayingsomething
Catwoman is on bruh this is the dumbest movie lmfao
Frances Conroy is in that god awful Catwoman movie with Halle Berry and that makes me sad.
Even though this is a TERRIBLE movie, #HalleBerry looks AMAZING in #CatWoman
The movie Catwoman is God awful but Halle Berry makes it watchable
Nah this catwoman movie is TERRIBLE. I forgot just how bad it was
She look hella fine in that suit though RT " @kdizz_: Wack ass movie “ @MrsJellySantos: Halle Berry's "Catwoman" is on”"”
Catwoman would be such a better movie if it was called Cat Lady and was about an old woman with 100 cats. @nickfull20
The Halle Berry "Catwoman" movie is on. I've never seen it, I wasn't allowed when it came out. This should be terrible.
@Geniusbastard *guiltily raises hand* I, uh, wasn’t able to finish that movie. The only other movie I’ve stopped w/out finishing? Catwoman.

@orchetect @Dusty_Kat So very many movie titles that works with…I submit Gigli, Catwoman, and Battlefield Earth. :-)
Catwoman Love this movie
Neither #Gotham nor DC Movie Universe can top Nolan's Scarecrow or Joker. They could easily best his Catwoman though.
Batman Returns will forever be my favorite Batman movie. Catwoman will never be as femdom again.
Just had a dream that @FKAtwigs was Catwoman in a new Batman movie.
It is decided. Much like Hitler, if you bring up Catwoman in a movie discussion you have automatically lost. This is christened Berry's Law.
Can we get a #PoisonIvy movie, please? But like, well done and everything. Not the Catwoman version. Come on now. #comics
@chowleen while the Wonder Woman movie is overdue, 2000's Batgirl, new 52 Supergirl, Gaiman's Death, all Catwoman are pretty awesome from DC
Am I supposed to believe Halle isn't the most attractive person in this movie because she wears shitty clothes and no makeup? #Catwoman

@TheaTrinidadTMT I love it!!! EXCEPT....You HAD to mention Halle Berry as Catwoman & remind me of that awful movie! U cannot be forgiven. ;)
The Catwoman movie was hilariously bad
. @OMWF81 Catwoman was horrible!! I was just talking to @noreencrayton about it a few days ago. The movie is almost unwatchable.

Watching #BatmanReturns on #bluray. This movie will never get old and the HD is ♡ @DCComics #Batman #newcomicbookday #catwoman #comic #meow
I love Batman the 60s 70s version I remember the movie were the Penguin, Joker, Riddler and Catwoman teamed up now why do that make me think
@kayemarrh It's like when they cast Halle Berry as Catwoman in a movie called Catwoman that had nothing to do with Catwoman.
After seeing #Gotham, I wonder how that #catwoman movie would've looked with Jada instead of Halle (probably a lot better).
Is there a new Catwoman movie coming out or is it Halloween already? pic.twitter.com/TvpItwYdmi
@stuperrins @MikeFitz538 It's about as Fantastic Four as the Halle Berry movie was Catwoman.

Still not as bad as Catwoman. “ @Shegstein: Jesus Christ, I just remembered there was this stinking excuse of a movie called Elektra.”
@Lambert2191 @dickfundy [whoever is responsible for the Catwoman movie]
Why that Catwoman movie with Halle Berry was made.... The world will never understand
So I'm watching Catwoman.....never realized how bad this movie kinda is
I'm currently watching the movie "Catwoman" and wishing my stomach was flat like Halle berry's
The new fantastic four movie is going to be so bad. Maybe worse than Catwoman
@HeyAnnieMok are you watching Batman Returns?? That movie was HUGE to me as a kid... must find photo of me, at 10, in costume as Catwoman

The #Catwoman (2004) movie is a dork rage inducing movie.
So we're watching Catwoman. Oh my god this movie is awful.
Catwoman with Halle Berry is probably the worst movie i HAVE EVER WATCHED
Halle Berry's catwoman has to be the worst superhero movie of all time
The Catwoman movie is so insanely terrible and I can't stop watching it.
Catwoman is the greatest superhero movie of all time, fight me on this
Catwoman is on, and good lord, how did this movie get made
I had no part in making the movie Catwoman so my life isn't all that bad.
Halle's basketball scene in Catwoman might be the corniest scene in movie history
@DavidUzumeri Have you seen the movie poster variant covers DC are doing in March? The Catwoman/Bullitt cover in particular is wonderful.

Watching old movies you haven't seen in forever.... Like the Catwoman movie I haven't seen since 2004.
Jennifer Lopez wants to act in a superhero movie. I predict the end of the genre will be when she's cast as Catwoman with Affleck's Batman.
The real superhero is this Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone) in the movie Catwoman. She is this strong and fierce without having cat blessings.
this gif was really killing it in time of the movie Anne Hathaway was perfect Catwoman #TheDarkKnightRises pic.twitter.com/De3ZEkOpuq
Halle Berry was bad as shit in Catwoman even know the movie sucked
Jeffs daughter is trying to argue with me that the catwoman movie is a good movie
why is the halle berry catwoman movie so bad but so good tbh
If you want to see a terrible superhero movie... I would recommend watching Catwoman with Halle Berry
[thinks about catwoman for 2 sec and then have to watch the whole movie]
#TV Halle Berry makes 'Catwoman' a truly interesting movie. Meow. #amwatching Certified armchair sexist.
Zoya and I both agree Catwoman is a terrible movie http://instagram.com/p/x9CeXPowAL/

Catwoman is such a movie
I forgot Halle Berry was also in this. As the sexy girl character. Remember Catwoman? Actually. That movie did NOT happen.
I liked a @YouTube video from @glittlep http://youtu.be/EXHFceaTPPw?a  Batman: Arkham Movie ( Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, Catwoman DLC,
Watching that Batman movie with Bane in it....not really liking it. It's kinda depressing. I like Catwoman though!
Yo Catwoman was the worst movie ever lmaoo
Catwoman with Halle Berry would be so perfect if Warner Bros gave the movie to DC cuz the plot of the movie is ass
Now watching "Batman: the Movie" Kinda bummed it's Lee Meriweather as Catwoman instead of Julie Newmar or Eartha Kitt
Fun Fact: I have false memories of having seen the movie Catwoman. When in fact I have only seen Batman Returns. #batmaninburtonland
Batman has a lot of cool toys, but if he uses anything but a laser pointer to catch Catwoman in the next movie, I'll be really disappointed.

Was the Halle Berry Catwoman movie written and directed by actual cat ladies? 30 minutes in and it feels to uncomfortably pandering.
@cookingterm from the makers of Sideways: The Video Game comes Catwoman, a terrible game based on an awful movie!
There needs to a new batman movie with Catwoman... And of course Halle Berry has to play Catwoman. #inaperfectworld
Catwoman is my favorite movie of all time.
I hate that the Catwoman movie is so fake lmao
Catwoman is a terrible movie, but Halle Berry fine as hell.
catwoman is the stupidest movie ever
"This is a movie about a Batman villain, not a Jenny from the Block video." Watching "Catwoman" w/ @Steffinephrine pic.twitter.com/tW6fcCCv2d
So I'm watching the Catwoman movie with Halle Berry and it is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen.
So who wrote Catwoman the movie and thought it’d be a good idea?
Watching The Dark Knight Rises. I wish they had given Anne Hathaway her own Catwoman movie.
It goes from "I guess I'll watch Catwoman" to "Wow Catwoman is the best movie ever."
The Halle Berry Catwoman movie was incredibly sack sha
Seeing it now, the movie Catwoman was just....
Just thinking about Batman Returns, and y'all might say that's an awful movie, but I have to reply: Michelle. Pfeiffer. Catwoman.
If a meta!Catwoman doesn't have a primary role in The Lego Batman movie I'll be disappointed. She's the closest to happiness Bruce has been.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roLfpRue0sQ&feature=youtube_gdata_player … damn it Hollywood, you give us a good CatWoman movie! #Selinaismyhero

@ChrisFawcettNYC Love this movie so much!!! #BatmanReturns (Obsessed with #MichellePfeiffer's #Catwoman!!) Happy Christmas, handsome!!!
Laying in bed, watching movie #6. The only film I've ever walked out of at the theater, which is Catwoman. It's a Christmas miracle.
What was better than the Jhonni Blaze sextape? Halle Berry's Catwoman movie.
@D8Iveta should definitely be catwoman if they make another movie;)
Ok, Catwoman movie is on... this is... err... words lack me for this. It's...oh, boy... that basketball scene. Oh, DC you just don't learn.
They scammed us " @TheGoogleFactz: Halle Berryís stunt double, in the movie "Catwoman", is a man."
I did love this movie growing up. It appealed to me more than the first Burton Batman because of Catwoman. Vicky Vale never interested me.
@spookychan If I was one of those people with too much time on my hands, I'd recut the movie so it was just about Catwoman.
@spookychan The movie has such a confused relationship with Catwoman. She's kind of an anti-hero, but she's "punished" for going too far.
Fuck this movie. Praise Catwoman though! #BatmanReturns
There’s some odd feminism in this movie. Its Catwoman against and using female tropes. #BatmanReturns
It's like on top of having Penguin and Catwoman, this movie was determined to cram in unused Joker plots as well. #BatmanReturns
The animated series drew most heavily from this movie, which is ironic because they did such a dodgy job with Penguin and Catwoman.

one of the things that makes BATMAN RETURNS the perfect Christmas movie is that Catwoman just fucking blows up a mall in the middle of it.
@BehindTheGiggle FTW the guy who played Spawn from the movie follows my Catwoman
The problem with Batman Returns is I just want to watch a movie with Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, but Walken and DeVito keep interrupting
Love this Christmas themed Batman movie! Michelle Pfeiffer is THE BEST CATWOMAN EVER — watching Batman Returns
No bad movie of 2014 was as bad as The Lone Ranger with Johnny Depp. That was the worst movie since Halle Berry's Catwoman
Okada @lexxcodi: It's a BIKE @K3hinde: So Catwoman just magically knew how to ride batman's bike. TDKR was just a stupid action-packed movie
@frankencomics Yeah, I still prefer a Catwoman movie. I know I sound like a broken record, but there it is. :P
@TimMcEwen67 Easily my favourite Batman movie! Catwoman & Penguin have alot to do with that too.

@SuperHeroSpeak aside from that, the 66 Batman movie had him fight Joker, Penguin, Catwoman, and the Riddler (and a rubber shark)
Seriuosly though that movie should have been called Catwoman Begins or something. 1. Michael Keaton was barely in the first half.
I echo what I heard someone on my Twitter list say a few days ago: Batman Returns is, if nothing else, a great Catwoman movie.
Watching Catwoman. This movie is kinda corny.

Joker and Catwoman team up. I'm waiting for Batgirl to get her own movie. #Batman #tvtag http://tvt.ag/1t5b9Ra 
@abouthebenjamin I toss between the two frequently. TDK is the better made movie, but TDKR harked back to Batman's story and had Catwoman!
#batmanbeyond movie is the sequel . #batmanreturns never got its true ending. Catwoman shows up as the Batman signal lights up.
CHoa as Catwoman for the next Batman Movie. or a Catwoman movie !

The Mist & Catwoman w/Halle Berry RT @seefrvncis: whats the worst movie you ever saw??
They should have ended the movie when Jason Bourne tried to kill Space Ghost in a galaxy far far away and Catwoman had to save the day.
So excited that Netflix got this movie!! My favorite catwoman!!! #Catwoman #BatmanReturns… http://instagram.com/p/vU6MHsGVLW/ 
I think Halle Berry as Catwoman was . But I think the director should have based that movie off the actual @DCComics character.
CATWOMAN though... lolz so many impossible things r made possble in dis movie @Mzansimagic @Halle_Berry_fan Halle b lookin good maan
When I think of hell, i picture a 17 hour Spirit flight and the only inflight movie is Catwoman
Anne Hathaway was not the perfect Catwoman..Halle Berry was just Hathaway had a better movie to work with.
Happy B-Day Anne Hathaway, Catwoman from Dark Knight Rises. Get this hoodie from the movie: http://goo.gl/zQdYyT 
If you had to live the rest of your life in a movie which one would you pick? — Catwoman http://ask.fm/a/bd2l170e

The perfect movie role for Bey would be a #super woman . I said this before but she would slay #catwoman @Beyonce Artist of The Year #AMAs
All I'm saying is that if there isn't a fight between Batman and Catwoman on/around see-saws in the new movie, I'm gonna be disappointed.

The ONLY other comic movie that had such a drastic change was 'Catwoman'. We all know how that turned out.... http://fb.me/30dGDJzXU 
The new FF movie sounds like it's going to be goddamn amazing. It's the most excited I've been for a comic movie since Catwoman. <:D
Still nobody who knows something about the newest CATWOMAN Movie ? Actress Name etc ? #Catwoman #DCComics #Comics #SuperHero
I want every video game to end with a boss battle with Sharon Stone from the Catwoman movie.
Catwoman puts a bird into her mouth because Tim Burton made this movie. #ReturnOfTheBat
#Movie Anne Hathaway Wants To Play Catwoman Again, Here Are The Details http://ift.tt/1sgZdFA 
Actually, this scene where Max "kills" Selina really makes me want to watch the Catwoman movie because both are terrible. #ReturnOfTheBat
I can't recall a time when I was less excited about an upcoming superhero movie. Maybe Catwoman in 2004. #FantasticFour #BlogterDoom
Anne Hathaway talks Catwoman cameos and standalone movie. http://buff.ly/1pKHWtW  * Anne Hathaway #AnneHathaway #HEADLINE
Dr. Doom is a Russian hacker? Oh my god. This Fantastic Four will be as faithful to the comics as the Catwoman movie was.

A non-Nolan canon Catwoman movie with Anne Hathaway. That's a thing people other than me want, right?

“ @BatmanNewsCom: Anne Hathaway wants to star in her own Catwoman movie http://batman-news.com/2014/11/09/anne-hathaway-wants-star-catwoman-movie/ …”. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Anne Hathaway wants to star in solo Catwoman movie. Yeah, cause those always do great at the box office http://wp.me/p4FHvm-5fI 
So Harley Quinn,& possibly/probably the Joker & Lex Luthor in the Suicide Squad movie.I'm calling it now that Catwoman is next. #MilaKunis ?

Round 3 of @chutneyexhibit’s impossible quiz is on literature. Ish. Example question, ‘Who wrote the novel ‘catwoman: the movie’?’

I love Catwoman the movie *dancing*
I really liked Anne's portrayal as Catwoman.. But I wouldn't call it iconic or anything. Barely saw her in the movie..
