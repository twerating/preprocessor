It would be hard for me to think of a better performance in a movie than Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight
There is NO GREATER OPENING to a movie than the Dark Knight. Seriously NOTHING tops that opening
The Dark Knight might be my favorite movie of all time. The Joker is too good.
I've watched The Dark Knight at least 10 times so far and I haven't finished it yet, I only move on when I finish all of the movie.

@Mysterious_1050 The Dark Knight Rises is probably the last time I anticipated a movie this much and that was three years ago.
The ONLY movie I've ever seen at midnight on the day it came out was The Dark Knight. After watching that trailer, "there's is another".
@PacSci Haven’t been this excited about a movie release since I saw The Dark Knight in ’08 (also at the Boeing IMAX)
I was so hyped for The Dark Knight Rises that I avoided trailers & it was such a good decision (I love that movie). Had to watch this 1 tho.

Back to the future was a terrible movie. It was a rip off of The Dark Knight https://vine.co/v/eQTFt0bi6Ee 
this comes from a combo of my anxiety and the fact that the dark knight shooting happened while i was also at a movie theatre. not fun.
@BryndenBFish Hey, I don't hate on what doesn't deserve to be hated. The Dark Knight is a great movie. Sucker Punch is not.
I rewatched The Dark Knight this week, and hands down feel the biggest mistake that movie makes is killing off Harvey Dent.
The dark knight is such a great movie

I don't care how many superhero movies are released in the future. The Dark Knight will be the best superhero movie of all time.

@NathanN610 nothing but The Dark Knight Rises was a great movie
I swear the Dark Knight rises is the best movie ever
@Dastmalchian watched the movie, Sushi Girl a couple weeks back and saw you, and thought, that's the crazy guy from The Dark Knight! Luv em!
I disliked the Dark Knight Rises the first time I saw it. Now I think it's the best superhero movie ever. Narrowly edging out Dark Knight.
The dark knight rises is the best movie and there is no denying it.

Just watched the end to The Dark Knight Rises and am still convinced that Nolan needs to make a Nightwing movie with Gordon-Levitt.
The Dark Knight is hands down my 2nd favorite movie of all time. Such a good one.
Spontaneously watching the Dark Knight, it's a 2 and a half hour movie
The only time I've teared up in a movie was when Batman jumped off that building in Hong Kong in The Dark Knight cause HOW AMAZING WAS THAT!
The Dark Knight is a top 10 movie all time
The very beginning of The Dark Knight is so awesome. Favorite movie ever.

I've been done with award shows ever since The Dark Knight Rises lost the Best Film Award to The Avengers at the 2012 MTV Movie Awards.
If you're ever feeling down, try to imagine Adam Sandler playing a very serious role in a movie such as the Joker in The Dark Knight.

The Dark Knight is possibly my favourite movie of all time.
The dark knight is literally my favorite movie I could watch it over and over and never get bored lol
@miss_mariii - ... The Dark Knight is incredible. Probably my favourite comic-book movie from a film-making perspective and story.
My go-to example, not because it's universal but because it bugs me but not necessarily everyone else, is in the Dark Knight movie.
The Dark Knight Rises will forever be the best movie ever

Does anybody else cry at the end of The Dark Knight Rises? I don't think I'll ever get over how amazing of a movie it is.
Movie endings can be the biggest teases ever. After watching the dark knight rises I got pumped up about a "Robin" movie that never was
The dark knight rises has the best ending to any movie.... Ever
The thing is THE DARK KNIGHT is actually super flawed as well. Ledger was ESSENTIAL for that movie.
Man, that reveal in The Dark Knight Rises is up there with the biggest cinematic reveals in movie history.
Will joseph levitt be in the batman vs superman movie or was it just a bullshit ending in the dark knight rises?
What I'm most upset about the Dark Knight movies is that they don't expand on Robin after Rises. Also....Batfleck for the next movie.

The Incredibles is the only film not called The Dark Knight that can be in the discussion for best superhero movie ever.

Cause it's a black movie. But the dark knight rises and trainwreck was in theaters and there's wax theater shooting by white people.
The most notorious movie theater shooting happened at a showing off The Dark Knight Rises. Batman. A comic book superhero. Think about that.

EVERYTHING about this movie is Zowie! and Kapow! instead of The Dark Knight. #BatNipples

Watching The Dark Knight for the 100th time. I love this movie.

And the award for biggest plot hole goes to... The Dark Knight Rises, for the WOLE GOD DAMN MOVIE.
I saw the Dark Knight & the Dark Knight Rises in '08 & '12 respectively on my birthday those years. Ant Man is the next hero movie for '15

The Dark Knight is the only Super hero movie respected in Hollywood because it's a crime drama with comic book characters.
Ultimately, though, which is the better movie? "The Dark Knight Rises" or "Trainwreck"?
Every time I watch The Dark Knight Rises, it makes me wish they would make another Batman movie so bad! Come on Hollywood!

I forgot how great Batman Begins is. On to my favorite movie of all time. The Dark Knight
I love it when a movie has an ending where the villain wins. The dark knight, gone girl, Se7en, usual suspects, no country for old men, etc
Inception is my favorite movie of all time followed closely by the Dark Knight. Nolan's movies made me want more than entertainment.
Insurgent is so bad... As most often, the sequels always end up being worse than their parent movie. Except The Dark Knight, of course
