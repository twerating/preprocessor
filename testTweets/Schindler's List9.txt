On the latest Doug Loves Movies podcast, they finally got to my theory that "Schindler's List" works for any movie in the tagline game.
-compelling a movie as Schindler's List. But that could also be an inherent bias toward Holocaust and biopic films...
Okay, you wanna know my honest opinion? I prefer Schindler's List. Jurassic Park remains an awesome movie, but I don't think it's as-
I saw a movie once where only the police and military had guns. It was called "Schindler's List." #History #2a

Schindler's List is not the best bed time movie. Why couldn't Liam Neeson be a Jedi in Nazi Germany? I would watch that movie before bed.
Watching "Red River" and wonder if this movie is the Hindu's "Schindler's List"
I like ALL IS LOST a lot, but calling it an action movie is like calling SCHINDLER'S LIST a rom-com.
Wow Schindler's List is on !! Haven't seen this movie in YEARS. Liam Neeson played Oskar Schindler very well !
I was going to eat dinner w/ my family. Then my dad turned on Schindler's List & that movie is just to sad to watch,especially while eating

Schindler's list is such a good movie
Watching "Schindler's List" for the 1st time, trying to figure out the classic/absolute trash movie ratio for Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley.
It's been a long time since I cried, so I want to watch a sad movie. Just not The Green Mile or Schindler's List. Those way are too much.
On this day in 1997, Schindler's List is the first movie televised completely without commercial interruption. http://ow.ly/2V3LP4 
In honor of the Oscars, a throwback to the beautiful music from the 1994 Oscar winning movie, Schindler's List. http://youtu.be/-vJwgpX2T0g 
honestly silence of the lambs is the only one id watch again for pleasure and schindler's list is a worthy if flawed movie but oof ugh argh.
American Sniper is the most impacting movie you've seen? What about Schindler's List...Sophie's Choice...even The Passion? Jeez people.
A movie named "Birdman" just won Best Picture. "Lawrence of Arabia." "Schindler's List." And now.."Birdman."
1993 Schindler's List won best picture. So a movie about slaughtering Innocent people (jews) makes sense. #OverreactingOverTheOscars
I think I figured out why they played the Schindler's list theme for Liam Neeson...it's his Oscar movie.
I'll never understand Liam Neeson's movie choices... The guy was in Schindler's List
@rgay If he made a movie called Schindler's List now, I imagine it would involve a list of people to kill.
My game is picking out what movie score is accompanying each announcer. Liam Neeson = Schindler's List.
First movie on my list- Schindler's list. Now watching
Liam Neeson do another movie like Schindler's List please

I think "ruin a movie with noun" is always funniest with Schindler's List because I imagine Liam Neeson nonplussed by everyday things
In hindsight, maybe Schindler's List was not the best movie to watch at the end of a bad day.
