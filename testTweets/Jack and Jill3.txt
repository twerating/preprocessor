@imbostontom jack and Jill is the worst movie you've seen really????? it's hilarious

@MariskaMovement @Mariska LOL! The song is the "theme" song for Jack and Jill (Adam sandler movie)
I think the only way I can be angrier at a movie than I was at Jack and Jill is if it's destroying something I love.
I mean, at that point it would HAVE to be intentional right. To make a movie worse than Jack and Jill, you have to try.

Adam Sandler should make his own Avengers-like team-up movie with Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, Zohan, Jack and Jill and the Waterboy.
Adam Sandler's 2011 film "Jack and Jill" won every single Razzie award possible. That's your definition of world's worst movie ever.
@DSFTWKTA I lost faith in Adam Sandler after that Jack and Jill movie lol I only want to watch it for Peter Dinklage
Just a reminder to everyone that Jack and Jill made $74 million domestically. Millions of people bought tickets to that movie.
@PixelsMovie hey can you pay me to go see ur movie i hear it's adam sandler's best since jack and jill
PIXELS at least has the excuse of being a CGI-heavy action movie. But JACK AND JILL is just a no-frills trashy comedy.
Also when ur gonna school a nerd on what a good romcom is (and also watch the spongebob squarepants movie and Adam Sandlers Jack and Jill)
For perspective, Jack and Jill, the movie you already forgot where Sandler played his female twin made more money. https://twitter.com/Variety/status/625524035741290499 …

Here's a short horror story to ruin your Saturday night: Jack and Jill (the Adam Sandler movie where he plays both) grossed $74,000,000.
Jack and Jill had a budget of 75 Million. that movie looks like it had 2 Million actually invested into the movie

Jack and Jill is the most racist movie since Birth of a Nation"
Read a review this morning saying Pixels is Sandler's worse movie since Jack and Jill. Not sure if I should take that as a challenge or not.
People are gonna shit on Pixels, but at this point, any Sandler movie is better than Jack and Jill.
Jack and Jill is without a doubt the worst Adam Sandler movie I've ever seen

@UltraMegaFat Jack and Jill is my mother's favorite movie, if you ever needed an explanation as to why I am terribly not funny.
I think Jack and Jill was released as a joke rather than the movie having jokes. Adam Sandler did it as a sort of avant-garde production.

My mom thinks my new book is great. That said, she also loved the movie "Jack and Jill" so take all that with a grain of salt.
Which is fitting since the film featured an Adam Sandler movie trailer which looks even worse than Jack and Jill.
