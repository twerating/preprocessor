Both THE MARTIAN and STEVE JOBS have been among the best of the year, in a strong fall movie slate. Have to see BRIDGE OF SPIES still.
I highly recommend the movie Bridge of Spies. It was my first movie at theaters since Skyfall. Yep, it'd been a while.

Bridge of Spies was the most perfectly photographed, scored, written, acted and directed movie I've seen in a long, long time.
Bridge of Spies was fantastic. Spielberg and Hanks doing what they do best: making movie magic. And it was written by the Coens too!

Bridge of Spies was pretty good. But it's always hard to watch a Tom Hanks movie that doesn't co-star Hooch.
The opening sequence of BRIDGE OF SPIES is among Spielberg's best work (and the rest of the movie is pretty good, too).
Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks, what a great movie! And I love that Amy Ryan!

BRIDGE OF SPIES: Turns out Spielberg still knows how to make a movie! Highly gripping and well-paced. Good stuff, Steve! 8/10
Bridge of spies look like a good movie
The preview for "Bridge of Spies" is terrible, but it's actually a pretty good movie. Also, highlights how odd Tom Hank's face looks.
I definitely recommend watching "Bridge of Spies". Such a great movie.

"Bridge of Spies." Great movie. However, with Spielberg, the Coens, and Tom Hanks, hard to screw up.
We are at the comfortable end of the world: recliners at the movie theater. (Seeing Bridge of Spies).

Bridge of Spies: 10/10. The Coen brothers, Steven Spielberg, and Tom Hanks came together and made movie gold with this one.
I guess bridge of Spies is an OK movie. I'm just tired of American movies about how great America is even if it's shit. I dunno. Moving on.

Watching Bridge of spies pretty good movie I give it 8 out of 10, man if you a spie, i guess you might as well die when you get caught
Bridge of Spies is a great movie. Also reinforced my hatred of any government agency similar to the CIA/FBI/NSA. So that made it even better
Tonight's movie: BRIDGE OF SPIES. I never miss a Tom Hanks-Mark Rylance movie.

Saw "Bridge of Spies" with @PinkyBahz. Great movie.
Bridge Of Spies for movie #2 today. Another good one from Spielberg and Hanks.
More wknd movie thoughts: Bridge of Spies, absorbing & old-Hollywood-efficient in another milieu I have a soft spot for. Rylance is a treat.
Trying to decide what movie to go see tonight, bridge of Spies or the Martian
i rly wanna see bridge of spies, it's probably my most-anticipated prestige movie this year
Bridge of Spies was such a Spielberg film. It was well done but not my type of movie.
John and I went to see the movie"Bridge of Spies" with Tom Hanks ... I highly recommend it!!! True story.:)

Bridge of Spies has 92% rating on rt. It was awful. The writing was so corny worse than a marvel movie. How much did spielberg pay for a 92.

I was pretty stoked to see @tomhanks's wife in Bridge of Spies cast age appropriately. That was pretty awesome. As was the whole movie.
Just watched Bridge Of Spies, and I loved it. Beautiful movie, informative. As it ended, a girl behind me said "cerita ni bosan la".
Bridge of spies is a brilliant movie!
Just walked out of 'Bridge of Spies.' Hands down most snore-inducing movie I've ever seen.
Bridge of Spies is NOT an "old ppl" movie. My oldness informs me there are only "thoughtful ppl" movies and "stupid ppl" movies. So there.
Another movie recommendation: "Bridge of Spies." Can't go wrong with Hanks and Spielberg.
